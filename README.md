# Fire Emblem: War of Lovers

## Story
Five years have passed since the War of Heroes concluded.
Marth, the Hero King, defeated the Dark Dragon Mediuth, finally
putting a decade of warfare to rest. The Seven Kingdoms
of Akaneia were unified, and Marth became Emperor of them
all. He also married his wife, Sheeda, making her Empress.

However, Marth has been missing for two years, and his
united empire is crumbling at the seams. Akaneia is in
a civil war, with the sage Marich and the hero Kris
struggling for control at every turn. More distant regions
dream of freedom, and rebel for independence. All claim
loyalty to the absentee Emperor, but ambitious figures
are more than willing to prosper from the chaos.

While Akaneia burned, Marth had gotten engaged with
Alear, from the far-off Lythos. His prior loyalties had
been replaced with loyalty to Alear.
But engagement wasn't sufficient: marraige was on the table.
Marth and Alear's wedding day will prove to be fateful...

Please read the attached CREDITS.md file.

## Known Issues
- Stats do not properly change when units are forcibly dismounted before an
  indoor map, or mounted after its completion. While these broadly cancel each
  other out, it is possible to gain or lose stats with poor timing.
  The command itself functions properly, as do movement adjustments.
- The game occasionally reverses the order of a scripted battle in the Chapter
  10 opening, locking the game. Restarting the chapter appears to fix it.
- Ballista animations can be buggy at times.
- Some character names are too long for certain menus. All should fit in menus
  that allow seven tiles for character names.
- The "L+R: Combine" graphic has a broken palette.
- Not every character has a voice clip.
- Summoned characters generally lack palettes, and many tier 2 and dismounted
  palettes are currently placeholders.
- Dialogue accounting for unit death is sporadic at best, and often assumes a
  dead unit is currently alive or shows placeholder text.
- Many newly added characters lack summon backgrounds, and almost all lack
  voice lines.
- Characterisation of many characters, Alear in particular, is dubious at best.
  This is intended to be rectified in the next major release.
- Some character portraits are placeholder requantisations.

## Patching Instructions
Apply War of Lovers.ups file to a clean American FE8 rom.

## Notes
- This release is gameplay complete up to Chapter 16. The storyline is also
  fully written assuming the player achieves all storyline objectives and
  keeps everyone alive, but placeholder text may appear if some are missed.
- All proper nouns are spelled as they are out of personal preference.
  They will not be changed, and please refrain from asking about it.
- Dialogue is written in British English. Please keep this in mind when
  reporting any typos.
- Testing was done in mGBA and VBA. Use any other emulator at your own risk.
  Mobile emulators are not supported.
- While attempts have been made to mitigate this, knowledge of the stories of
  FE1 and 3 is highly recommended. Knowledge of FE2, FE6 and 7, and Engage 
  are also recommended to a lesser degree.
- DSFE save points are present. They replace suspend, so be wary when finishing
  a gameplay session.
