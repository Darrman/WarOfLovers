# Fire Emblem: War of Lovers

## Story
Five years have passed since the War of Heroes concluded.
Marth, the Hero King, defeated the Dark Dragon Mediuth, finally
putting a decade of warfare to rest. The Seven Kingdoms
of Akaneia were unified, and Marth became Emperor of them
all. He also married his wife, Sheeda, making her Empress.

However, Marth has been missing for two years, and his
united empire is crumbling at the seams. Akaneia is in
a civil war, with the sage Marich and the hero Kris
struggling for control at every turn. More distant regions
dream of freedom, and rebel for independence. All claim
loyalty to the absentee Emperor, but ambitious figures
are more than willing to prosper from the chaos.

While Akaneia burned, Marth had gotten engaged with
Alear, from the far-off Lythos. His prior loyalties had
been replaced with loyalty to Alear.
But engagement wasn't sufficient: marraige was on the table.
Marth and Alear's wedding day will prove to be fateful...
