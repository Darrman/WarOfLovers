# LETHAL EMBLEM

## Story
After several different Evening Train Crashes, Mario and company finally reach
their destination of Derry. However, due to the assistance of Yukari Yakumo,
the train did not crash today. This did not stop shocking things from happening,
resulting in employment by Halden Electronics, a notoriously lethal company to
work for. Turnover rate is high: because employees keep dying. Mario works his
way up the ranks and soon faces the dangerous planet Artifice, with a quota of
5,000 coins (as far as he's concerned) to earn.

By all accounts, it appears that Halden Electronics have something to hide.
Are they linked to the Space Pirates? Are they in charge of them? Just why is
there that terrible monster on Gordion, the company's headquarters? What part
of the world do they recruit from? Do they recruit from beyond Earth?
Mario and his colleagues will only learn the truth if they meet their profit
quota today. All that seperates them from safety are the dreaded Old Birds,
notoriously unpredictable robots, and the rising tide of a dangerous flood.
And not everybody has been accounted for: are there survivors in the mines?
It may be advisable to cut losses if it means meeting the quota.
