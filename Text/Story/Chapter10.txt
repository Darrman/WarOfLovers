## Ch10WorldMap
After bidding Queen Guinevere farewell, Lilina[N]
and company rushed back to Lycia.[AN]
The defeat of (rebel) did nothing to stem the[N]
tide of dissatisfaction in Bern,[AN]
and plans to free Bern from a perceived Lycian[N]
puppet regime continued.[AN]
As Ostia is to Lycia's western frontier, Pherae[N]
is to its eastern border. Though typically a[AN]
peaceful march, bandits from the Bolm Mountains[N]
are not an infrequent annoyance for Pherae.[AN]
But as Eliwood charged through these mountains[N]
in an effort to preempt any strike by Bern,[AN]
a horrifying sight greeted him as Pherae Castle[N]
drew into sight.[A][X]

//Merlinus and the boss, let's say Citrinne
//She can try to bribe him and kill him when it goes wrong
[ML]
So, you're here to negotiate?[N]
I'd be happy to normally,[AN]
but Queen Lilina ordered me[N]
not to negotiate at all.[AN]
[MR]
Merlinus... You've served Pherae for[N]
over twenty years in an attempt to[AN]
earn profits from your merchant[N]
business. Can't I change your mind?[AN]
[ML]
I don't even know your name. Are you[N]
the commander of these Bernese rebels?[AN]
[MR]
My name is Citrinne. I'm King Diamant's[N]
cousin, so when you think about it,[AN]
that makes me Princess Citrinne of[N]
Brodia. It's a pleasure to meet you.[A]
[ML]
Princess of Brodia? That doesn't have[N]
anything to do with Alfonse, does it?[AN]
[MR]
Alfonse? How do you know... no. Nothing.[N]
I don't know what you're talking about.[AN]
[ML]
You do! You definitely know Alfonse. And[N]
Alfonse has allies from beyond Elibe.[AN]
You look nothing like any mage I've ever[N]
seen. You must be one of his allies![AN]
[MR]
Whoever put that idea into your head?[N]
I serve the Divine One and his majesty.[AN]
Now, I don't like the way these talks[N]
are going. Perhaps they should end?[AN]
[ML]
No, no. I am open to a peace offering.[N]
What do you want me to do, Citrinne?[AN]
[MR]
Well, it wouldn't be fair to demand[N]
an absolute surrender. I'll give you[AN]
more land in Brodia than the entire[N]
march of Pherae to run your business.[AN]
And I'll give you a lump sum of a[N]
million gold to start out too.[AN]
[ML]
A million gold?! Not even Queen Lilina[N]
has that much money to her name.[AN]
This deal... I think it's too good to[N]
be true. How can you be this rich?[AN]
[MR]
Brodia's mineral wealth goes a long[N]
way. A million is small change.[AN]
[ML]
...And who's to say a million in Brodia[N]
is worth a hundred in Lycia?[AN]
I don't trust any of this! I must ask[N]
you to leave this instant![A]
[MR]
If I told you I knew where Roy is,[N]
would you be convinced?[AN]
[ML]
Master Roy... Tell me. Where is he?[N]
I must know![AN]
[MR]
I'll tell you this much: he's on[N]
his way back to Lycia.[AN]
[ML]
He is?! Well in that case, I can't[N]
agree to any surrender of Pherae.[AN]
It's been a month since Eliwood[N]
was here last. He should return soon.[AN]
And when Roy returns, we'll be saved.[N]
These negotiations are over![AN]
[MR]
I never said that Roy would be on[N]
Lilina's side, Merlinus. Now are[AN]
you on Lilina's side or the Divine[N]
One's side? Choose wisely.[AN]
[ML]
I may once have been a peddler, but[N]
my loyalty to Lycia is set.[AN]
I am on Queen Lilina's side of this[N]
war. Now get out of Pherae![AN]
[MR]
Merlinus, for being Roy's chief advisor,[N]
I'd have thought you more intelligent.[AN]
You made the wrong decision. You declined[N]
my generosity. Your life is forfeit.[A]
[ML]
No... You wouldn't dare attack an[N]
unarmed man during a truce.[AN]
[MR]
SHAVER![A]
[ML][Clear]
[MR]
How irritating. I've never seen anyone[N]
decline a gift before.[A]
[FFL][LoadFace][0x6B][0x01][MoveFarLeft]
//generic red
Lady Citrinne! Enemies spotted to the[N]
east! They're coming from Bern![A]
[MR]
So, is Guinevere stopping her rebels?[N]
Isn't this also an invasion?[AN]
[FL]
They're not Bernese, though. It's[N]
Queen Lilina and Marquess Pherae![A]
[MR]
Interesting... Troops! We defend[N]
Pherae Castle at all costs![A][X]
