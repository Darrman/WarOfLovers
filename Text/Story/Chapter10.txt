## Ch10WorldMap
After bidding Queen Guinevere farewell, Lilina[N]
and company rushed back to Lycia.[AN]
The defeat of (rebel) did nothing to stem the[N]
tide of dissatisfaction in Bern,[AN]
and plans to free Bern from a perceived Lycian[N]
puppet regime continued.[AN]
As Ostia is to Lycia's western frontier, Pherae[N]
is to its eastern border. Though typically a[AN]
peaceful march, bandits from the Bolm Mountains[N]
are not an infrequent annoyance for Pherae.[AN]
But as Eliwood charged through these mountains[N]
in an effort to preempt any strike by Bern,[AN]
a horrifying sight greeted him as Pherae Castle[N]
drew into sight.[A][X]

## Ch10OpeningFatalNegotiations
[ML][LoadMerlinus][MR][LoadCitrinne]
//Merlinus and the boss, let's say Citrinne
//She can try to bribe him and kill him when it goes wrong
[ML]
So, you're here to negotiate?[N]
I'd be happy to normally,[AN]
but Queen Lilina ordered me[N]
not to negotiate at all.[AN]
[MR]
Merlinus... You've served Pherae for[N]
over twenty years in an attempt to[AN]
earn profits from your merchant[N]
business. Can't I change your mind?[AN]
[ML]
I don't even know your name. Are you[N]
the commander of these Bernese rebels?[AN]
[MR]
My name is Citrinne. I'm King Diamant's[N]
cousin, so when you think about it,[AN]
that makes me Princess Citrinne of[N]
Brodia. It's a pleasure to meet you.[A]
[ML]
Princess of Brodia? That doesn't have[N]
anything to do with Alfonse, does it?[AN]
[MR]
Alfonse? How do you know... no. Nothing.[N]
I don't know what you're talking about.[AN]
[ML]
You do! You definitely know Alfonse. And[N]
Alfonse has allies from beyond Elibe.[AN]
You look nothing like any mage I've ever[N]
seen. You must be one of his allies![AN]
[MR]
Whoever put that idea into your head?[N]
I serve the Divine One and his majesty.[AN]
Now, I don't like the way these talks[N]
are going. Perhaps they should end?[AN]
[ML]
No, no. I am open to a peace offering.[N]
What do you want me to do, Citrinne?[AN]
[MR]
Well, it wouldn't be fair to demand[N]
an absolute surrender. I'll give you[AN]
more land in Brodia than the entire[N]
march of Pherae to run your business.[AN]
And I'll give you a lump sum of a[N]
million gold to start out too.[AN]
[ML]
A million gold?! Not even Queen Lilina[N]
has that much money to her name.[AN]
This deal... I think it's too good to[N]
be true. How can you be this rich?[AN]
[MR]
Brodia's mineral wealth goes a long[N]
way. A million is small change.[AN]
[ML]
...And who's to say a million in Brodia[N]
is worth a hundred in Lycia?[AN]
I don't trust any of this! I must ask[N]
you to leave this instant![A]
[MR]
If I told you I knew where Roy is,[N]
would you be convinced?[AN]
[ML]
Master Roy... Tell me. Where is he?[N]
I must know![AN]
[MR]
I'll tell you this much: he's on[N]
his way back to Lycia.[AN]
[ML]
He is?! Well in that case, I can't[N]
agree to any surrender of Pherae.[AN]
It's been a month since Eliwood[N]
was here last. He should return soon.[AN]
And when Roy returns, we'll be saved.[N]
These negotiations are over![AN]
[MR]
I never said that Roy would be on[N]
Lilina's side, Merlinus. Now are[AN]
you on Lilina's side or the Divine[N]
One's side? Choose wisely.[AN]
[ML]
I may once have been a peddler, but[N]
my loyalty to Lycia is set.[AN]
I am on Queen Lilina's side of this[N]
war. Now get out of Pherae![AN]
[MR]
Merlinus, for being Roy's chief advisor,[N]
I'd have thought you more intelligent.[AN]
You made the wrong decision. You declined[N]
my generosity. Your life is forfeit.[A]
[ML]
No... You wouldn't dare attack an[N]
unarmed man during a truce.[AN]
[MR]
SHAVER![A]
[ML][Clear][X]

## Ch10OpeningReinforcements
[MR][LoadCitrinne]
How irritating. I've never seen anyone[N]
decline a gift before.[A][Event]
[FFL][LoadFace][0x6B][0x01][MoveFarLeft]
//generic red
Lady Citrinne! Enemies spotted to the[N]
east! They're coming from Bern![A]
[MR]
So, is Guinevere stopping her rebels?[N]
Isn't this also an invasion?[AN]
[FL]
They're not Bernese, though. It's[N]
Queen Lilina and Marquess Pherae![A]
[MR]
Interesting... Troops! We defend[N]
Pherae Castle at all costs![A][X]

## Ch10OpeningPheraeIsRuined
[ML][LoadEliwood][MR][LoadLilina]
...Oh no... We're too late.[N]
Eliwood, I'm so sorry.[A]
[ML]
It's not your fault, Lilina. Bern[N]
got to Pherae before us.[AN]
But surely it could hold out in a[N]
siege. What did Merlinus do?[AN]
[MR]
Look, the drawbridge is down.[N]
He must have started negotiations[AN]
anyway, and they can't have gone in[N]
our favour. If Pherae has fallen,[AN]
we must liberate it. Otherwise, the[N]
rest of Lycia will fall as well.[A]
[ML]
Indeed. This is my home. Merlinus,[N]
the knights, my people... It is my[AN]
duty as Marquess Pherae to defend[N]
my people and govern my territory.[AN]
If the drawbridge is lowered, then[N]
we can counter-attack. All units,[AN]
charge into Pherae Castle! We must[N]
reclaim it for Lycia![A][X]

## Ch10OpeningMarthLives
[FL][LoadCitrinne][Right][LoadEliwood][FR][LoadMarth]
[Right]
The battle must have ended recently.[N]
There's no sign of anybody.[AN]
[FL]
Hahaha! So you must be Marquess Pherae.[N]
If you were a day earlier, this castle[AN]
would still be yours. I entered into[N]
talks with your representative, but he[AN]
wasn't interested in co-operating.[N]
He let me in, and I invited my army in.[AN]
[Right]
What did you do to Merlinus?![N]
Where are the knights of Pherae?![A]
[FL]
Merlinus? He was an obstacle in the[N]
Divine One's plans for Lycia. He[AN]
didn't see fit to accept my generous[N]
gifts, so he was... eliminated.[AN]
[FR]
What does Alear have planned for[N]
Lycia? Answer me, Citrinne![AN]
[FL]
How do you know my name? Wait...[N]
You're Emblem Marth! You lived![AN]
His majesty King Diamant really[N]
did see you in Bern![AN]
The Divine One would be delighted[N]
if you came back.[AN]
[FR]
Do not call me that. And I will not[N]
rejoin Alear.[A]
[Right]
King Diamant? So, is he the one[N]
pulling all the strings?[AN]
[FL]
Oh no. Everything we do is for the[N]
glory of the Divine One.[AN]
Marquess Pherae, hm, it clashes with[N]
the Divine One's narrative, but[AN]
you are a powerful man. The Divine[N]
One would consider you a useful ally.[AN]
Lord Eliwood, I'll offer you the same[N]
deal I gave Merlinus. Land in the[AN]
Kingdom of Brodia of area larger than[N]
this march and a million gold. Deal?[AN]
[FR][Clear][LoadLilina]
How dare you attempt to bribe Marquess[N]
Pherae! Your conduct is despicable.[A]
[Right]
Absolutely not. Her majesty is correct.[N]
Pherae means everything to me.[A]
[FL]
Ah, Queen Lilina of Lycia. The Divine[N]
One has no room for you in her vision.[AN]
The only way would be... Never mind.[N]
Surrender now, or face the consequences.[AN]
[FR]
Never. Alear and her allies have caused[N]
too much trouble. We will liberate[AN]
Pherae, and we will never surrender to[N]
the likes of you![AN]
[FL]
Stubborn to the end, I see. All troops,[N]
drive the Lycians out of the castle![A][X]

## Ch10AfterPrep
[ML][LoadExecutioner]
//needed more than one Bernese boss with a face!
[MR][LoadWolt]
//prisoner: Wolt will do
I can't believe we were defeated[N]
so easily. The enemy commander[AN]
brought a whole army with her.[N]
We had no choice but to surrender.[A]
[ML]
Pipe down, Lycian brat! You may[N]
have defeated us last time, but[AN]
Roy's long gone. Bern will bow[N]
down to nobody![AN]
If I were in charge I'd execute[N]
the lot of you on the spot,[AN]
but this Citrinne calls the shots.[N]
Why does this "Divine One" have[AN]
the final call on military actions?[N]
If the commander doesn't give[AN]
her approval, I'll just start the[N]
executions myself anyway![AN]
[MR]
Oh, Lilina... Lord Eliwood...[N]
What are you doing in Bern?[AN][X]

## Ch10RedTape
[FL][LoadCitrinne][FR][LoadExecutioner]
Commander, regarding the prisoners,[N]
I request authorisation to execute[AN]
them as soon as possible. They will[N]
prove dangerous to Bern if released.[AN]
[FL]
All executions require the approval[N]
of King Diamant, in addition to[AN]
consent being gained from (Arcardo Jr.)'s[N]
army in case of further use. Time[AN]
for negotiation is also important, in[N]
case any prisoners decide to defect.[AN]
[FR]
How long do you expect approval[N]
to take, commander?[A]
[FL]
Between our base, travel time to[N]
Lythos, Etrurian approval...[AN]
About a month, give or take.[N]
Many people must be informed.[AN]
[FR]
Very well, miss. May the Divine[N]
One come to a quick decision.[A][X]

[ML]
I've had to chase bandits away from[N]
Pherae many times. But these are[AN]
no mere bandits. This is a coalition[N]
of several armies.[AN]
[MR]
Eliwood... I remember when we were[N]
in this room during a bandit attack.[AN]
You were bedridden, I wasn't allowed[N]
out, and Roy had to save us.[AN]
But bandits from the Bolm Mountains[N]
never actually overrun the castle.[AN]
//[ML]
//This is my home. My people's home.[N]
//We've taken Pherae back, but the[AN]

What does Alear gain from assembling[N]
the Twelve Emblems? Why is Alear[AN]
so determined to see the end of us?[N]
She has Roy. Why destablise Elibe?[A]
[ML]
Lilina, I have no idea. It makes no[N]
sense to me at all. I can only hope[AN]
we get answers.[N]
// First, Merlinus. He[N]
//must be given a proper burial.[AN]
There's something I need to find,[AN]
and I hope the enemy didn't steal it.[A][X]

## Ch10EndingWhenWillWeGetHome
[Left][LoadMarth][Right][LoadSheeda][FL][LoadChiki]
Marth, I'm so tired. We've been[N]
marching up and down mountains[AN]
and hills for weeks. And it always[N]
seems to be so cold. When are we[AN]
going to get home? Are we going to[N]
get home? Are we stuck on Elibe?[A]
[Left]
Chiki, we will get home. I promise.[N]
But I can't promise you that we'll[AN]
get home any time soon. We're a[N]
very long way away from home now.[AN]
It might take us months. It may even[N]
take us years. But we will return.[A]
[Right]
What will we even return to? The last[N]
thing we heard before running through[AN]
the Dragons' Gate was Kris crowning[N]
himself. Did Rody make it to Aritia?[AN]
Does he know we're alive? Does anyone[N]
know we're alive, or where we are?[A]
[Left]
Alear. She knows. Her allies probably do[N]
too. We never did see Great Sage Gato[AN]
before arriving in Elibe: I wonder if[N]
he knows anything about this war?[AN]
[FL]
Gato? Do we really need his help?[N]
I've never heard him talk about Elibe.[AN]
But just because he never mentioned it[N]
to me doesn't mean he doesn't know.[AN]
He knows a lot of things I don't. Maybe[N]
he does know about the Dragons' Gate...[A]
[Right]
I've done some research into figuring[N]
out where Elibe is in relation to[AN]
Akaneia, but I've come up with nothing.[N]
Either we pick a direction and sail[AN]
until we reach land, or try to go back[N]
through the Dragons' Gate. But since[AN]
nobody's made it past the Western Isles,[N]
there could be thousands of miles of[AN]
ocean and we might run out of food.[N]
On the other hand, we don't know how[AN]
the Dragons' Gate even operates.[N]
Even if we get through, who's to say[AN]
if Gato will be in the Ice Dragons'[N]
Temple? If he isn't, an uncharted[AN]
mountain range will seperate us from[N]
Orleans. I don't like either scenario...[A]
[FL]
I don't want to be trapped on Elibe[N]
forever... I miss Pales. I miss home.[A][X]

## Ch10EndingForNinian
[Left][LoadEliwood][Right][LoadChiki]
[Left]
Ah, there you are. Chiki, I don't[N]
know if this will work, but I'd[AN]
like you to try it. This is a stone[N]
my wife always kept with her.[AN]
She was an Ice Dragon, while you[N]
are a Divine Dragon.[AN]
[Right]
I can use every dragon stone type,[N]
so it should work. But isn't this[AN]
your wife's stone? Wait, are you a[N]
dragon too, Eliwood?[AN]
[Left]
No. It's a long story. I met Ninian[N]
about twenty-five years ago by now.[AN]
//We know Nergal is Ninian's father. Does Eliwood?
//Nils cries after Nergal dies in Hector mode (maybe 19xx is needed?)
//so he subconsiously knows - it's reasonable Ninian would subconsiously know
//as well. If she's looking at images of Nergal and Aenir in 19xx, let's say
//she connected the dots and then told Eliwood at some point.
Technically speaking, she was half-[N]
dragon; her mother, an Ice Dragon,[AN]
her father, a human. Yet he lived[N]
for over a thousand years...[A]
[Right]
I've been alive for about that long,[N]
but I've been asleep most of the time.[AN]
Was he asleep for most of the time[N]
too, or was he awake?[A]
[Left]
Awake. Nergal was a pitiful man, in[N]
the end. He wanted power, but he[AN]
had completely forgotten why he[N]
wanted it over the years.[AN]
I met Ninian as she was fleeing from[N]
Nergal with her brother. I had[AN]
rescued her from the Black Fang -[N]
Nergal's assassin's guild - and[AN]
things moved from there. We fell in[N]
love as I fought the Black Fang[AN]
with my friends...[AN]

[Left]
So, Marth really does live.[N]
Veyle was wrong all along.[AN]
How could he have possibly[N]
survived such a shipwreck?[AN]
[Right]
He clearly has friends in high[N]
places. Not as high as you,[AN]
Divine One. Either that, or he[N]
just got lucky.[A]
[FR]
King Diamant, nobody compares to[N]
the Divine One! She is beyond[AN]
compare! Nobody on the planet even[N]
remotely stands up to her![A]
[Left]
Good work, Framme. I can always rely[N]
on you to say the correct thing.[AN]
[FR]
Oh, the Divine One complimented me![N]
She's the most generous person ever![A]
[FL]
King Diamant, how fares the campaign[N]
in Elibe? Do I need to engage?[AN]
[Right]
Emblem Roy, I have good news. The[N]
Marquess of Laus will soon be[AN]
toppled. Her reign of terror will[N]
soon come to a screeching halt.[AN]
[FL]
Of course I can't go back myself,[N]
but who'll rule Lycia when this[AN]
campaign is finished up? Nobody has[N]
said a word to me. Lythos may be[AN]
my home now, but I was still born[N]
in Lycia. I wish it well.[AN]
[Left]
As I've said, Lycia will be in[N]
reliable hands. We have allies[AN]
in Etruria and Bern making sure[N]
that Lycia is stable.[AN]
[FL]
I'm glad King Mordred and Queen[N]
Guinevere are keeping the peace.[AN]
But someone needs to be the head[N]
of the Lycian League.[AN]
[Left]
How did you say it again...[N]
Marquis? Was it Duke?[AN]
[Right]
Divine One, did we not agree this?[N]
We promised Lycia to our friend--[AN]
[Left]
Right, the agreement was to have[N]
Marquess Tania as head of Lycia.[AN]
[FR]
Splendid recollection, Divine One![N]
I'm sure Lycia will prosper![A]
[FL]
This is good news. Lycia is in good[N]
hands. I just hope this is the plan.[AN]
Foreign intervention into Lycia does[N]
unnerve me somewhat.[AN]
[Right]
The soldiers of Laus are making their[N]
last stand in Ostia. You are the only[AN]
commander to have taken it, Emblem Roy.[N]
I will have to engage with you.[AN]
[FL]
Of course, King Diamant. It's always[N]
a pleasure working with you.[AN]
I will lend you all of my strength.[N]
We will expel Laus from Ostia and[AN]
reinstate... who? I forget. I'm drawing[N]
a blank. Did Lord Hector die[AN]
childless? That sounds wrong, but the[N]
throne of Ostia is currently vacant...[A]
[Left]
Roy, Diamant and I need to finalise[N]
the plans to finish Lil-- er, Laus.[AN]
Framme, would you mind escorting Roy[N]
away for a few minutes?[AN]
[FR]
Of course, Divine One. Roy, how would[N]
you like to join the Divine Dragon[AN]
Fan Club? Member No. 2 was killed in[N]
action, so he needs replacing.[AN]
//insert proper terminology here, check Clanne/Framme supports
[FL]
Sure? Good luck with your planning,[N]
Alear. Walk the winning road.[A]
[Clear][FR][Clear]
[Right]
Roy's gone. I'll just take off the[N]
Emblem Ring for a moment in case[AN]
he can hear us. He might turn like[N]
Marth did if he hears the plans...[A]
[Left]
And that would be absolutely horrible.[N]
My heart can only take so much.[AN]
Diamant, lead the charge into Ostia[N]
personally. Burn it down. Raze[AN]
it to the ground. Extinguish any and[N]
all memory of the city.[AN]
[Right]
If that is your will,[N]
then I will carry it out.[AN]
[Left]
But before you obliterate Ostia,[N]
Diamant, you must lynch Lilina.[AN]
[Right]
She isn't in Ostia currently.[N]
She was last sighted in Pherae.[AN]
And what of Eliwood? Is his death[N]
required to keep Roy on-side?[AN]
[Left]
I am not taking any risks, Diamant.[N]
Love is powerful, and familial[AN]
love is just as potent as romantic[N]
love. Father could sway son.[AN]
[Right]
Of course. Queen Lumera's love[N]
is what makes you who you are.[A]
[Left]
Thank you, Diamant. You're right.[N]
But if Marth can remember Sheeda[AN]
and defect on a minor prompt,[N]
what will happen if you see Lilina[AN]
or Eliwood while you're engaged?[N]
Surely he won't disengage?[AN]
[Right]
He'll be a disembodied spirit.[N]
He won't be able to defect.[AN]
[Left]
Of course. He may be a Physical[N]
Emblem, but this is where his[AN]
spirit form will prove useful.[N]
Don't give Roy a chance to defect.[AN]
[Right]
You have my word. I'll have Alcryst[N]
back me up during the attack.[AN]
Lyn may not be physical, but her[N]
ring still holds great power.[AN]
[Left]
Excellent. Two more things, Diamant.[N]
One: Don't forget to take an orb.[AN]
I hope they're as strong as Veyle says.[N]
Two: I can't stand the thought of[AN]
my marriage to Roy being disrupted[N]
by that pesky Lilina. She will not[AN]
get in my way. I'm coming to Ostia[N]
personally to see her dead![A][X]
