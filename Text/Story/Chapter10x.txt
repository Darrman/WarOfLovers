## Ch10xWorldMap
With Pherae freed from enemy occupation,[N]
a return to Ostia was suggested.[AN]
But after receiving a tip-off, Lilina[N]
opted to visit Araphen.[AN]
It is located on Lycia's eastern border,[N]
and its marquesses, rather ill-tempered.[AN]
During a wartime meeting, Bern attacked,[N]
killing Lilina's father, Hector, with[AN]
the power of the dragons, along with most[N]
other people in attendance.[AN]
While the area has since been rebuilt,[N]
officially, there is no marquess.[AN]
And so, for the second time in five[N]
years, Araphen fell to Bernese forces,[AN]
with barely a token resistance being[N]
put up. But this time, the Bernese have[AN]
Brodian accomplices, who have their own[N]
reasons for occupying Araphen.[AN]
Lilina's brief detour to pay her respects[N]
will result in a battle beginning...[A][X]

## Ch10xOpeningJadedJade
[MR][LoadJade]
Hmph. So this is Araphen? From the[N]
reports I have received, this is[AN]
where Emblem Hector is located.[N]
I must thank the Bernese soldiers[AN]
who took the castle for us. Now,[N]
where is he?[AN]
I can only hope I wasn't given[N]
bad information. Isn't Hector[AN]
the Marquess of Ostia? Yet his[N]
daughter is ruling Ostia instead.[AN]
And she's Emblem Roy's wife.[N]
The Divine One wants her dealt[AN]
with. Now that I think about[N]
it, if she's such a threat to[AN]
Roy, she'd be a threat to Hector[N]
as well. I doubt the Bracelet[AN]
Emblems would be any different...[N]
We've found six bracelets. Surely[AN]
there are six more out there.[N]
//Six mainline: Alfonse grabbed the Veronica bracelet himself
Companions to each ring?[AN][X]

## Ch10xOpeningAlcrystSaysHello
[ML][LoadAlcryst][MR][LoadJade]
Your highness! What brings you[N]
here today? I've found a lead[AN]
regarding one of the Emblems.[N]
Apparently Hector is here...[AN]
[ML]
Excellent! You're far better[N]
at this than me.[AN]
I've searched for months, looking[N]
for Emblem Lyn in Sacae.[AN]
And I met a woman who said her[N]
father fought with Lyn in a[AN]
war about twenty-five years ago![AN]
//...That would make Lyn forty![AN]
//I don't think Lyn ever says how old she is...
Oh, what am I going to do...[AN]
This woman also said she fought[N]
with Roy, and never saw Lyn.[AN]
[MR]
So you met someone who knew[N]
Emblem Roy, and her father[AN]
knew Emblem Lyn? Interesting.[N]
But where is Emblem Lyn?[AN]
[ML]
//Sue's second-hand information: Alcryst's best lead
This woman said she married a[N]
Lycian man. That sounds odd.[AN]
She loves Sacae above all.[N]
Why marry someone from outside?[AN]
[MR]
Maybe she met someone during that[N]
war your source mentioned.[AN]
Still, there's a lot of Lycia and[N]
we haven't found Lyn anywhere.[AN]
Your highness, you are more than[N]
capable of finding her.[AN]
[ML]
Sigh... You all think so highly[N]
of me. I don't understand why.[AN]
But now's not the time for this.[N]
I must take up my position.[AN]
Send a messenger to Badon if you[N]
need me, for some strange reason.[AN]
Our plan must succeed. For the[N]
Divine One![A][X]

## Ch10xOpeningPayingRespects
[ML][LoadLilina][MR][LoadEliwood]
[ML]
I've been so busy lately, I've[N]
not had the time to visit...[AN]
But the eastern border still[N]
requires inspection, and it[AN]
won't take us too much longer[N]
to make it to Ostia this way.[AN]
[MR]
Araphen feels... quiet. I know we[N]
took the back entrance, but[AN]
surely we'd have seen some guard,[N]
whether friend or foe.[AN]
[ML]
You're right. Did the enemy just[N]
leave the castle abandoned?[AN]
That makes no sense. I'm sure[N]
there are some forces inside.[AN]
But... here it is. My parents'[N]
grave. We haven't moved them[AN]
to Ostia with the wars and[N]
other priorities coming up.[AN]
[MR][CloseEyes]
Hector... Lyn... Watch over us.[N]
As a friend and comrade, I will[AN]
do what I must to save Elibe.[N]
You were taken from us too soon,[AN]
but there's nothing we can do.[N]
Rest in peace, my friends.[AN]
[ML][CloseEyes]
Father... Mother... Are you proud?[N]
I've been trying my best to rule[AN]
Lycia alone. But we're under attack[N]
from a truly distant enemy.[AN]
They say you're one of the "Emblems",[N]
Mother... I cannot let them win.[AN]
Elibe never asked for Elyos's[N]
interference. I will stop it.[AN][X]

## Ch10xOpeningUnplannedMeeting
[ML][LoadJade][MR][LoadMarth]
[ML]
//Enough time has passed that she's been informed
...Emblem Marth? This is my chance.[N]
The Divine One will be delighted.[AN]
Two Emblems in one day! Perfect.[N]
One big swing, and...[AN]
[Event]
//miss sound
[MR]
Your name is Jade, right? King[N]
Diamant's servant.[AN]
[ML]
I missed. I need backup. Troops,[N]
prepare to fight![AN]
The enemy are inside this castle![N]
Emblem Marth is leading them![AN]
[MR]
So, Brodia's noticed us. We're[N]
going to have to fight it out.[A][X]

## Ch10xLughVillage
[ML][LoadFace][0x5F][0x01][MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML]
So Bern rolled over Araphen again.[N]
That's not particularly surprising.[AN]
Then they just left after handing[N]
over the castle to this "Brodia"[AN]
bunch. Apparently they really want[N]
to find Hector. You know... the[AN]
old Marquess of Ostia? Dead?[N]
Do they really not know that?[AN]
Apparently they don't. Well, I[N]
can't just let you go without[AN]
something nice, so here you go.[N]
Chase out those invaders![A][X]

## Ch10xSouthVillage
[ML][LoadFace][0x61][0x01][MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML]
You know, I heard that the[N]
last marquess before Bern[AN]
killed him and left the throne[N]
vacant slighted the queen's[AN]
mother once. Something about[N]
him disliking Sacaeans.[AN]
Well, he died childless and[N]
now the march is in limbo.[AN]
I can't say I'm overly fond[N]
of Queen Lilina, but I also[AN]
can't say much good about[N]
Bern! And the less said about[AN]
this Brodia cult the better.[N]
Divine this, Emblem that...[AN]
Bah! Throw them into the sea[N]
already. They can't win![A][X]

## Ch10xEndingBracelets
[Left][LoadMarth][Right][LoadLilina]
What is this bracelet? The enemy[N]
commander was wearing it.[AN]
[Left]
I've never seen anything like it.[N]
She did mention something about[AN]
"Bracelet Emblems"... I don't[N]
remember those in my time on Elyos.[AN]
But I have a hunch. If Alear wanted[N]
to make Chiki an Emblem, then[AN]
perhaps she was tied to a bracelet.[N]
There are twelve Emblem Rings.[AN]
//Alear never made any great secret of being an Emblem at the end of Engage
//But did she tell Marth about that in this hack?
//She probably did. Let's say she's above them, like the Sword of Seals is
//to the Divine Weapons, and doesn't count as part of the Twelve.
Are there twelve Emblem Bracelets?[N]
And who could they correspond to?[AN]
[Right]
Father, too? Can't he just rest?[N]
Where did this bracelet come from?[AN]
Should we destroy it, and stop any[N]
potential interference?[AN]
[Left]
No, Lilina. We shouldn't destroy[N]
anything. We must collect as many[AN]
of these bracelets as possible,[N]
so that Alear can't use them.[AN]
We don't have time to exhume your[N]
parent's bodies, but I doubt[AN]
Brodia knew they were deceased.[N]
I don't think your father has[AN]
been dug up and turned into some[N]
sort of undead Emblem...[A]
[Right]
...The thought of it makes me[N]
sick. We've done our job here.[AN]
We've chased the enemy away[N]
from Araphen. We must set off[AN]
towards Ostia! We cannot wait[N]
any longer than is necessary.[AN]
[Left]
Emblem Bracelets... Just what[N]
could these truly be?[A][X]
