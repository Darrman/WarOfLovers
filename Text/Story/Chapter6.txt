## Ch6WorldMap
The Garda Ocean, north of Talis, is a[N]
rough and windswept sea.[AN]
Outside of the port it is named for,[N]
there are few settlements along its[AN]
shores. All there is to be found are[N]
the occasional pirate base and rock.[AN]
The further north one sails, the colder[N]
the air gets. Rumours of great treasure[AN]
abound, but few ever lay their eyes on[N]
structures such as the Ice Dragons'[AN]
Temple. Marth visited it once before.[N]
Now, he aims to return, biding his time[AN]
until the eyes of Lythos and Askr look[N]
away from Akaneia...[A][X]

## Ch6OpeningOnABoatAgain
[ML][LoadMarth][MR][LoadSheeda]
[ML]
I never expected to have flee for[N]
my safety on a boat again...[AN]
Yet here we are, sailing north of[N]
Talis to see if there's any harbour[AN]
near the Ice Dragons' Temple. All[N]
because of Alear's massive navy...[A]
[MR]
Marth... I think I understand[N]
how you felt now.[A]
[ML]
What do you mean, Sheeda?[A]
[MR]
When you first arrived on Talis,[N]
I mean. You had lost everything[AN]
you had ever known, and had just[N]
finished a voyage through very[AN]
dangerous waters to find safety.[N]
And now, I'm doing the same thing...[AN]
[ML]
As Gra was to Aritia,[N]
Lythos is to Talis...[A]
[MR]
You left Aritia with the last of[N]
their knights. I left Talis...[AN]
with you. At least I have you.[N]
I love you, Marth. We will make[AN]
it back one day... Surely we will[N]
defeat Kris and stop Alear.[A]
[ML]
Not surely, Sheeda. Assuredly.[N]
Lythos will pay the price...[AN]
I love you too, Sheeda. One day,[N]
we will return to Akaneia, and[AN]
right everything that has gone[N]
wrong in my absence.[AN]
And yet, no sooner do I return[N]
before I have to flee again.[AN]
[MR]
It's strange how that is...[N]
But return we must. You, me,[AN]
and Chiki... I wonder how she[N]
feels about all of this.[AN]
[ML]
I should go and talk to her.[N]
This must be hard on her.[AN]
[MR]
Wait... Marth, I think I see[N]
something on the port side...[A][X]

## Ch6OpeningPiratesSpotted
[ML][LoadMarth][MR][LoadSheeda]
[ML]
...I can't see much in this fog,[N]
but I think I see a ship.[AN]
Let's try to sail on past, but[N]
they might not be friendly...[AN]
[MR]
//Later versions: Gazack clone says some generic thing
//"Haha, only a fool would sail up here" or whatever
It's likely they're pirates.[N]
Call up the soldiers and prepare[AN]
for battle: the pirates might[N]
attempt to board our ship and[AN]
slow us down. The Lythos fleet[N]
is almost certainly chasing us...[A][X]

## Ch6AfterPrepGetTorches
[ML][LoadMarth][MR][LoadChiki]
Marth! I went looking around in[N]
the ship looking for something[AN]
to clear this fog away. I found[N]
some torches. I hope they help![A]
[ML]
They should, Chiki. Thank you.[A][X]

## Ch6LythosFleetArrives
[MR][LoadLouis]
Hmm... I've been watching the movements[N]
of Sheeda's escape vessel for a while.[AN]
This fog is dangerous, though. We don't[N]
know where there may be rocks...[AN]
Men! The Divine One's orders are clear.[N]
We must recover Emblem Marth, no matter[AN]
what! Once the enemy soldiers have taken[N]
up positions, that is when we strike![A][X]

## Ch6LythosRetreatBoss
[Right][LoadLouis]
The seas beyond here are extremely[N]
dangerous. As much as I want to[AN]
keep observing Sheeda and her little[N]
crew, my survival is more important.[AN]
Drop anchor; the Divine One will be[N]
with us shortly.[A][X]

## Ch6LythosRetreatNoBoss
[Right][LoadFace][0x6B][0x01]
//generic red soldier
T-t-the commander's dead! The[N]
Divine One's going to be livid![AN]
I'm sick of all of this fog![N]
That's it! Everyone, retreat![A][X]

## Ch6GettingWindy
[ML][LoadMarth][Right][LoadSheeda][FR][LoadChiki]
[FR]
We did it! We survived![N]
What do we do now?[AN]
[ML]
What we should do now is keep[N]
sailing. We might lose Lythos[AN]
if we can disappear into the[N]
fog. But we can't see either...[AN]
[Right]
Marth... Chiki... It's getting[N]
a lot windier all of a sudden...[AN]
And there's no sign of that pirate[N]
ship either. Just where are we?[AN]
[FR]
I can feel the wind too. It's cold...[N]
just like the Ice Dragons' Temple...[AN]
Are we... in a storm? I'm getting[N]
a bit scared. What should I do?[AN]
[ML]
On reflection, I think we should drop[N]
anchor. It's too dangerous to sail.[AN]
Let's get below deck and wait for[N]
this to blow over.[A]
[Right]
I'll fly around outside for a while[N]
to keep an eye on things.[A][X]

## Ch6LandNearby
[ML][LoadMarth][Right][LoadSheeda][FR][LoadChiki]
[Right]
Marth! There's land to our west. We[N]
should get to shore as soon as we[AN]
can. It's not safe out here.[AN]
[ML]
You're right, but this ship's[N]
steering isn't very good.[AN]
One gust of wind in the wrong[N]
direction and...[A][X]

## Ch6HitRock
[ML][LoadMarth][Right][LoadSheeda][FR][LoadChiki]
[FR]
What was that bang?[N]
Marth? Will we make it?[AN]
[ML]
Oh no... We hit a rock.[N]
We're taking on water.[A]
[Right]
Can we make it to[N]
solid ground?[AN]
[ML]
If we don't hit any more[N]
rocks, it's possible.[AN]
Now what is that noise...[N]
Oh no...[A][X]

## Ch6Shipwrecked
[ML][LoadMarth][Right][LoadSheeda][FR][LoadChiki]
[Right]
Ice Dragons... Marth! We need[N]
to get out of here before[AN]
this ship completely sinks![N]
Otherwise, it's all over...[AN]
[Event]
[FR]
Marth... Help! I'm being...[N]
blown away![AN]
[ML]
Chiki, you're going to have[N]
to transform again![AN]
If you get blown into the sea,[N]
you aren't going to last long![A]
[FR]
[Event]
Where's my Divine Stone? Oh no![N]
It's gone! Where is it?[AN]
[ML]
It's... we'll look for it later.[N]
Right now, you need to hold on![A]
[FR]
I... can't hold on... Marth...[N]
help me, please... Ahhh![A][Clear]
[Event]
[ML]
CHIKI! Sheeda... get out of here![N]
This ship isn't going to make it...[AN]
Save yourself. I'll just slow you[N]
down if I take a ride on your pegasus.[AN]
[Right]
No! I won't leave you behind, Marth.[N]
Hold on until I can reach you.[AN]
[ML]
It's no good... My grip's... slipping...[N]
Sheeda... Why are you still here...[AN]
[Right]
I've said it already.[N]
I won't leave you![A]
[ML]
[CloseEyes]Marich[Beat][....] Ellis[Beat][....] Chiki[Beat][.....][N][OpenEyes]
Sheeda[Beat][CloseEyes][.....] Please[Beat][....] live[Beat][A][Clear]
[Event]
[Right]
Marth? MARTH! MARTH! I won't be[N]
able to fly away soon...[AN]
I'm near land... I can make it...[N]
I will make it...[A][X]
