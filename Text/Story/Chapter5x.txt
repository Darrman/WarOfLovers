With Alear's forces on Talis defeated,[N]
Marth and Sheeda decide to secure the[AN]
nearby island of Peraty, located to[N]
the south of Talis.[AN]
Before the War of Darkness, it was an[N]
independent kingdom under the rule of[AN]
Manuu, a Fire Dragon. Marth killed[N]
him after his evacuation from Port Warren,[N]
leaving a power vacuum in his wake.[AN]
A notoriously isolationist realm, none[N]
saw fit to bother Peraty during the[AN]
War of Heroes. But once again, Marth[N]
steps foot on Peraty's shores.[AN]
His reception on the Salamander's[N]
holy land would prove frosty.[A][X]

## Ch5xOpeningReturnToPeraty
[ML][LoadMarth][MR][LoadSheeda]
[ML]
Peraty is not somewhere I was[N]
planning on revisiting.[AN]
If we occupy it, that's one[N]
fewer angle of attack if Kris[AN]
or Alear try to take Talis.[N]
But I doubt we are welcome.[AN]
[MR]
We can survey Peraty, at least.[N]
If they wish to remain neutral,[AN]
then we should respect that. But[N]
if Kris launches an attack...[AN]
[ML]
We will defend ourselves if it[N]
comes to it. Let's go.[A][X]

## Ch5xOpeningMoodyOguma
[MR][LoadOguma]
Hm... I can't prove it, but I[N]
have that feeling that someone[AN]
is going to show up today.[N]
I know enough about what's going[AN]
on in Akaneia to know it's a mess.[N]
Did Marth reappear, or did he get[AN]
a divorce on another continent?[N]
Who's holding Port Warren?[AN]
I heard Kris's faction took it[N]
over recently. Will they respect[AN]
Peraty's neutrality? Marich did,[N]
but will Kris? Ha...[AN]
Who am I to talk? I didn't object[N]
when Marth went in back then.[AN]
It was either that or get cornered[N]
in Port Warren. That's war.[AN][X]

## Ch5xOpeningNeutralityIsNonsense
[MR][LoadAthena]
//let's say Athena is the boss, there's not enough remake characters
So, ve have arrived on Peraty.[N]
Emperor Kris said this island[AN]
is full of pirates. Very dangerous.[N]
But ve have nothing to fear.[AN]
These foes are veak, very much so.[N]
Vun voman is all that ve need![AN]
Kris also said Peraty claims to[N]
be a neutral country.[AN]
But our enemies may use that as[N]
a cover story! I expect that[AN]
some enemy rebels live vith[N]
these pirates. Ve shall win![A][X]

## Ch5xLongTimeNoSee
[ML][LoadOguma][MR][LoadSheeda]
[MR]
Hello, Oguma. It's been a while,[N]
hasn't it? We need to talk.[AN]
After the War of Heroes you just[N]
disappeared. Why?[AN]
[ML]
Ah... Well... you don't need[N]
me anymore, do you? You've[AN]
got plenty of other people[N]
able to protect you.[AN]
[MR]
Don't dodge the question.[N]
Necessity doesn't matter.[AN]
[ML]
...Well, let me ask my own[N]
questions, your highness.[AN]
How do I put this... Are the[N]
rumours true?[AN]
That you and Marth got...[N]
Aren't together... split?[AN]
[MR]
...Ah. I understand. No.[N]
They are not.[AN]
[ML]
I see. Look, you're here now,[N]
and I'm not getting out of this.[AN]
I was born here on Peraty.[N]
My father was Akaneian, my mother[N]
Grunian. They must have annoyed[AN]
the wrong people, because my[N]
father got executed.[AN]
My mother got banished here,[N]
and soon I was born.[AN]
She died when I was young, and[N]
then it was Norda for me.[AN]
Years of being a slave gladiator[AN]
took a bitter, bitter toll.[N]
Eventually, I had enough of it.[AN]
[MR]
And then I happened to see you[N]
getting whipped to death.[AN]
[ML]
I was always appreciative of you[N]
saving me then. But as time went[AN]
by... I suppose those feelings[N]
begun to get deeper.[AN]
You're a married woman now. It[N]
would be awkward. Distracting.[AN]
So I decided to try to put it all[N]
behind me, and disappear.[AN]
[MR]
I understand your point. But I don't[N]
want you to disappear.[AN]
Our paths have crossed once more.[N]
Please, will you lend me your sword?[AN]
[ML]
If that is what you desire, then[N]
I cannot refuse, your highness.[A][X]

## Ch5xHouse1
[ML][LoadAnna][MR][LoadCurrent]
//Anna is a placeholder for random villagers
[ML]
The nearby fort was always the[N]
limit of Peraty's reach.[AN]
Go west of here and you'll end up[N]
at an Akaneian installation.[AN]
From there, you're not too far[N]
from Port Warren. There was the[AN]
occasional exile that crossed the[N]
bridge, but it wasn't common.[AN]
Now I see Akaneia's civil war[N]
has spilled over. Why do[AN]
you have to keep causing so[N]
much trouble around here?[A][X]

## Ch5xHouse2
[MR][LoadCurrent]
//How do I get the hint that Oguma lives here, even if he's on the map?
Looks like nobody's home. I'm not[N]
going to steal this sword.[A][X]

## Ch5xHouse2Oguma
[MR][LoadOguma]
Home. Well, I won't be here for[N]
a while. Better make sure the[AN]
place is tidy when I come back.[N]
Oh, I should take this with me.[A][X]

## Ch5xHouse3
[ML][LoadAnna][MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML]
You... You're with Marth. I'd know[N]
that man's standard anywhere.[AN]
Here for another invasion, huh?[N]
One toppled king not enough?[AN]
I suppose he's spoiling for an[N]
annexation now. Yeah, I've[AN]
heard he's disappeared to Lythos[N]
or whatever the new emperor said.[AN]
But I think Lythos is about as[N]
real as Jugdral. That is, not.[AN]
Is this whole civil war just a[N]
very roundabout purge of Marth's[AN]
enemies? I would love it if you[N]
could just leave us alone. Out![A][X]

## Ch5xVillage
[ML][LoadAnna][MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML]
Let's just say I'm well-informed.[N]
This town was an Akaneian penal[AN]
colony in years gone by. It hasn't[N]
been used since before the War[AN]
of Darkness, but the connections[N]
do remain. You're Talisian,[AN]
I've heard of the battle there[N]
the other day. Well, I suppose[AN]
I'll lend you a hand. I'd prefer[N]
Sheeda over that Alear figure.[AN]
The enemy commander is Athena.[N]
Nobody knows where she's from,[AN]
but she's been firmly on Kris's[N]
side of the war in Akaneia.[AN]
She's swift, agile, and evasive.[N]
You'd need a precise weapon to[AN]
handle her. How about one of[N]
these? One swing and you've[AN]
solved your myrmidon problem.[N]
Now, can anyone use it?[A][X]

## Ch5xEndingCantRunHere
[Left][LoadAnna][Right][LoadMarth][FR][LoadSheeda]
[Right]
The fact that we defeated one of[N]
Kris's commanders means we can't[AN]
stay here. Peraty is now on his[N]
radar. We've interfered enough.[AN]
[Left]
//some generic guy to represent the current ruler
So, your civil war has finally[N]
dragged us into it.[AN]
I recognise you from last time.[N]
You've grown up a lot,[AN]
but I believe you're Marth. And[N]
you must be Sheeda.[AN]
[Right]
You would be correct, sir. Who[N]
might you be?[AN]
[Left]
Ever since you killed King Manuu,[N]
Peraty has been unstable.[AN]
We've had our own troubles between[N]
various different tribes.[AN]
I lead one of them. While I[N]
cannot profess myself to be[AN]
overly fond of your actions,[N]
I do appreciate you do not[AN]
desire to launch any war of[N]
conquest against us.[AN]
[FR]
We had considered stationing[N]
some troops here, but I[AN]
believe you would refuse us[N]
permission to do so.[AN]
We apologise for trespassing[N]
on your territory, sir.[AN]
[Left]
Yes... Well, please depart from[N]
Peraty as soon as possible.[AN]
You are not welcome here.[N]
I understand a ship has sailed[AN]
from Talis and landed here.[N]
I expect it to be gone tomorrow.[AN]
[Right]
Of course... we understand. I am[N]
sorry for the damage we have[AN]
dealt to your country via my[N]
actions. Please, forgive us.[AN]
We will depart tonight. Do you[N]
have any further requests?[AN]
[Left]
No. That is all. May Salamander[N]
have mercy on you.[A][X]

## Ch5xEndingDiamantAndAlfred
[ML][LoadDiamant][MR][LoadAlfred]
[MR]
Cough... Diamant, it is good to[N]
see you. Are you well?[AN]
[ML]
I am. I've almost finished my plans[N]
for protecting the Emblems.[AN]
After all, we both know what happened[N]
to Emblem Marth. If it happens again?[AN]
That could do untold damage. So,[N]
I'm going to eliminate any and all[AN]
potential opposition to my Emblem.[N]
Perhaps it is a harsh plan.[AN]
But I do not think there is any[N]
alternative. Do you have any?[AN]
[MR]
Well, I've been planning for my own[N]
Emblem. We've been looking around.[AN]
Celine tells me I've been working[N]
myself too hard, but she's wrong.[AN]
I can't stop working. The Divine[N]
One needs the Emblems back.[AN]
And the Physical Emblem plan...[N]
I cannot let her down.[AN]
I have a kinder solution for the[N]
Sheeda problem, if you will.[AN]
How about we provide an alternative?[N]
A replacement Marth, if you will.[AN]
[ML]
A replacement? No, I don't think[N]
that would work. We'd get caught[AN]
out at some point, and that could[N]
cause a major problem for us.[AN]
[MR]
I'd be lying if I said I didn't[N]
have some misgivings with your[AN]
plan. It's very... bloody.[N]
Celine would feel the same way.[AN]
Cough... But it's not my place[N]
to stop you. The Divine One[AN]
told us to secure the Emblems[N]
by any means necessary...[AN]
[ML]
I do see your point. But once these[N]
particular people are dead...[AN]
They're dead. They cannot sway the[N]
Emblems any longer.[AN]
[MR]
During my research I have found[N]
Corrupted... There may be a way.[AN]
It was good talking to you, Diamant.[N]
I have lots of work to do.[AN]
Tell Alcryst I said hello. I'd[N]
like to stay for longer...[AN]
[ML]
I will, Alfred. May our plans succeed,[N]
and may the Divine One be reunited[AN]
with the Emblems. Of course, this[N]
involves Emblem Marth. She went to[AN]
meet him personally, so perhaps he[N]
has put an end to his war.[A][X]
