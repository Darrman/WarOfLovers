## Ch4WorldMap
Marth successfully crosses the dangerous[N]
Devil Mountain and makes his way to the[AN]
port town of Garda.[Event] Garda is a remote[N]
town, far from any major power centres.[AN]
Due to its isolation, it has had to deal[N]
with frequent piracy from along the coast.[AN]
Its garrison, loyal to Marich, has seen[N]
little conflict in the civil war so far.[AN]
Garda was the first step outside of Talis[N]
for Marth during the War of Darkness;[AN]
Kris has never visited the region. But[N]
his latest announcement has Garda deeply[AN]
concerned: if Marth really has abdicated[N]
and divorced Sheeda, is a United Akaneia[AN]
worthwhile? Marth arrives in a besieged[N]
Garda: another faction has attacked...[A][X]

//Could make Kashim if I was using more FE people
Sir Rody, it's not good news. More of[N]
the enemy have landed and are preparing[AN]
for an attack. We do not know of the flag[N]
they fly, or who they are loyal to.[AN]
[ML]
You've heard the messenger earlier. It's[N]
been a few days, so Kris- "Emperor" Kris,[AN]
already has us declared traitors. If I had[N]
to guess, these are from that Lythos place[AN]
and loyal to that Alear woman. They must[N]
have formed an alliance. I find her claim[AN]
to have married Emperor Marth extremely[N]
difficult to believe. He was always loyal[AN]
to Empress Sheeda. But people can and do[N]
change. Speaking of Sheeda, Talis report?[AN]
[MR]
Yes sir. Last we heard, the isle is[N]
receiving a heavy naval assault.[AN]
We haven't made any contact in the[N]
last 24 hours: there are simply too[AN]
many ships belonging to the enemy.[N]
In addition, the supply situation is[AN]
critical. Nothing has made it past[N]
Devil Mountain in months, and sea[AN]
imports have been cut off by that[N]
navy. I'd say we have about a week[AN]
until Garda starves. What do we do[N]
once the food runs out, sir?[AN]
[ML]
Let's not do anything rash. Either[N]
Marth will reveal himself and tell[AN]
us all the truth, or... I don't want[N]
to imagine Kris being truthful.[A]
[FFR]
//off-screen guard: will be a generic soldier no matter what
Sir Rody! Unfamiliar individuals[N]
approaching from the west![AN]
[ML]
Tell me more, soldier.[N]
Are they with Kris?[A]
[FFR]
We don't know. They might be envoys.[N]
They might be spies. They don't seem[AN]
to be in any uniform: certainly they[N]
aren't sharing any clothing...[A]
[ML]
How do they look? What is their[N]
physical appearance?[A]
[FFR]
They've hoods up, I can't really tell.[N]
I think there's a young man.[AN]
And he's got a little girl with him.[N]
Shall we bring them in for questioning?[AN]
[MR]
Not the sort who should be wandering[N]
around during a war... Now that I[AN]
think of it, I heard rumours of a dragon[N]
being spotted on Devil Mountain.[AN]
[ML]
I don't normally take rumours seriously,[N]
but I've got an idea of what's happening.[AN]
What type of dragon was it?[AN]
[MR]
The rumour said golden, which suggests to[N]
me only one type of dragon.[AN]
[ML]
Divine... Chiki... If she's re-emerged,[N]
Marth can't be far. Bring me to them![A][X]

## Ch4Marth

Garda... I haven't been here in a[N]

[FL]
We're close to Talis.[N]
Where's Sheeda?[A]

There's a harbour in Garda, where[N]
we can sail into Talis. But with[AN]
the gates closed, we can't get in.[N]
Let us hope they're friendly...[A]

//If I ever get hooded mugs drop the hood
[Left]
Very well. My name is Marth Lowell,[N]
Emperor of Akaneia and King of Aritia.[AN]
[FL]
And I'm Chiki! Me and Marth were looking[N]
for Sheeda. Do you know where she is?[AN]

...And that is why we are under attack.[N]
If this Alear had you as her play thing,[AN]
she must be a dangerous opponent indeed.[N]
Lythos will not wait long: they will[AN]
launch another attack soon. Do you have[N]
any ideas, my emperor?[A]
[Left]
The most important thing we can do is[N]
push the Lythian forces back into the sea.[AN]
After that, we need to relieve Talis...[N]
But we lack any navy.[AN]
[FL]
Can't I just fly over there?[N]
I don't need any boat.[A]
[Left]
It's too dangerous, Chiki. You can't[N]
fly over by yourself; they'll shoot[AN]
you down with the sheer quantity of[N]
ballista fire. But we have to get[AN]
over to Talis somehow. Rody, how[N]
long do we have until Talis falls?[AN]
[MR]
It's been about a day since we last[N]
got any word from them. It's not[AN]
looking good. I'm expecting the worst[N]
to come before sundown.[A]
[Left]
Then there's no time to waste.[N]
We will drive the invaders out.[A][X]

## Ch4AfterPrep
[MR][LoadBoucheron]
I've read up on our plans. The Divine[N]

enemies will help her get Marth back.[N]
Let's not disappoint her, men![A][X]

[ML]
I just heard the latest news.[N]
Kris has succeeded in his[AN]
usurpation of Marth's throne.[N]
Such a brazen liar: I doubt[AN]
that "Alear" or "Lythos" even[N]
exist. He probably got that[AN]
woman of his, Katarina, to play[N]
dressup for the day. I know[AN]
little of what goes on in Pales,[N]

This used to be the site of a storage[N]
tent. But their services were the[AN]
most inefficient annoyances on the[N]
entire continent! Anyone who needs[AN]
logistics at scale hires mobile[N]

That's progress for you. Why have[N]

Empress Sheeda - maybe it's only Queen[N]
Sheeda now, but if Kris had his way[AN]
she'd have no title at all. Regardless,[N]
she's the Queen of Talis. No ifs or[AN]
buts about it. Queen regnant. Akaneia[N]
have no claim to Talis without her.[AN]
And personally, I quite like the idea[N]
of freedom from those warmongers![A][X]

I couldn't begin to tell you about[N]
the army currently invading us.[AN]
The flag they fly is unlike any on[N]
Akaneia. I know the world is far[AN]
larger than the old Seven Kingdoms,[N]
but they're not from along Anri's[AN]
Way. Nor are they Valencian. Jugdral?[N]
Unlikely. But what's beyond Jugdral?[A][X]

Huff... I can't rest now. I have to[N]

Ah! That was a close call. I need[N]

Oh Marth... Why did you just vanish?[N]
If this is the end for me, then I[AN]

you are now...[A][X]

Sheeda? Is that you? Finally![N]
I haven't seen you in years![AN]
I'm sorry for disappearing.[N]
It's a long story. How are you?[AN]
[MR]
Marth... you're back. I have some[N]
terrible news. Talis has fallen.[AN]
The invasion was led by a woman with[N]
red and blue hair. Alear, I think...[AN]
the person who claimed you married[N]
her in your absence. Is that true?[AN]
[ML]
No. I love you, Sheeda. I always have.[N]
I'm so glad you're safe. I've got a[AN]
lot to tell you, but right now we must[N]
fight. We will take Talis back.[A]
[MR]
Of course. I've got a lot to tell you[N]
as well. But first, we must win.[A][X]

## Ch4KashimComesClean

Kashim, good day. I hope we can take[N]
Talis back soon. I've spoken to your[AN]
mother recently: she and your siblings[N]
are in the finest of health.[AN]
[MR]
Well, if you've seen her there's no[N]
point in me trying to get some[AN]
cash out of you. I don't need to beg[N]
any more: this job pays well.[AN]
[ML]
It does, but you've managed to[N]
accrue quite a sum of wealth[AN]
considering the wages you're[N]
paid as part of Garda's garrison.[AN]
[MR]
What are you implying? My family's[N]
house is entirely above board![AN]
[ML]
I never said anything about that.[N]
You're the breadwinner for your[AN]
family. So keep on the straight[N]
and narrow and I won't need to[AN]
investigate anything. Are we[N]
in agreement here, Kashim?[AN]
[MR]
Um... Mother... No, I can't let[N]
her get punished for my actions.[AN]
I can't let what happened to Leen[N]
happen to anyone else...[AN]
//Kaga notes worked into the game! Not to be confused with FE4 Leen:

The world has gotten very dangerous[N]
lately. That invading army seems[AN]
obsessed with worshipping their[N]
"Divine Dragon", whatever it may[AN]
be. Not only that, but I've heard[N]
rumours of a golden dragon making[AN]
an appearance on Devil Mountain.[N]
Is that thing a scout for Mediuth's[AN]

We have killed the enemy commander.[N]
All remaining forces are in retreat.[AN]
What do we do now?[AN]

Well, we have to liberate Talis...[N]
But I have no idea how to do it.[AN]
[FL]
If I could fly out, I could fly back[N]
in. But I could only bring one[AN]
person with me at a time, and two[N]
people can't save my home...[A]
[Left]
Chiki thought of something similar[N]
earlier. Even if it was the three[AN]
of us, two targets for ballista fire[N]
are still easy to take down.[AN]
Without a ship, we can't get any[N]
large amount of soldiers to Talis.[AN]
[MR]
The Garda garrison is quite small,[N]
//and Emperor Marth, you only have[AN]
//about a dozen soldiers. We'd only[N]
and Emperor Marth, you do not have[N]
very many soldiers. We'd only need[N]
a single boat. We're going to[AN]
check if the enemy forces left any[N]
seaworthy vessels behind them.[A][X]

## Ch4EndingStory
//Might need a bit of a rewrite to reduce exposition later on
[FL][LoadChiki][Left][LoadSheeda][Right][LoadMarth]
[Left]
So, when was the last time the three of[N]
us were just sitting in a room?[AN]
[Right]
About two years ago. Sheeda, I have to[N]
explain what I know about this threat.[AN]
Far, far away, beyond the shores of the[N]
known world, is the continent of Elyos.[AN]
Their culture revolves around worship[N]
of their own Divine Dragon, Alear.[AN]
[FL]
But I can only think of three Divine[N]
Dragons. Me, Chainy, and Gato. Where[AN]
does Alear fit into this? Was there[N]
a falling out somewhere?[A]
[Right]
As far as I know, there is no relation[N]
between the Narga tribe and Alear's[AN]
line, the royal family of Lythos.[N]
One day, I was signing bills into law[AN]
when I fainted without warning.[N]
When I came to, everything was a blur.[AN]
Apparently something had worked and I[N]
had become solid, making Alear happy.[AN]
[Left]
But Marth, you were always solid.[N]
I'm not seeing ghosts, am I?[AN]
[Right]
Don't worry, Sheeda. I'm perfectly[N]
solid. Anyway, another Elyian item[AN]
is the Emblem Ring. These apparently[N]
have the spirits of "great heroes[AN]
from other worlds" or some such, but[N]
in reality they're typically just[AN]
pale imitations of historical figures.[N]
Certainly nothing otherworldly.[AN]
[Left]
How many of these rings are there,[N]
and what do they actually do?[AN]
[Right]
Twelve, but Alear had been looking[N]
into finding more of them.[AN]
One of them had an image of Queen[N]
Celica of Valencia. There were[AN]
some from Jugdral's distant past...[N]
One claimed to be of Akaneia's[AN]
future, but unless they learned how[N]
to time travel, that's impossible...[A]
[FL]
Marth, didn't you say Alear wanted[N]
to turn me into an Emblem?[A]
[Right]
Right... So Sheeda, the main power[N]
of the Emblem Rings is the power[AN]
to "engage" with them. It gives the[N]
ring's wearer additional powers.[AN]
[Left]
Engage... You don't mean they're[N]
wedding rings, do you, Marth?[AN]
You told me that you didn't get[N]
married to Alear earlier on...[AN]
[Right]
It was a close-run thing. My mind[N]
was rarely allowed to wander back[AN]
home to Akaneia. Usually I had to[N]
sing the praises of Lythos or Askr,[AN]
who Alear has entered an alliance[N]
with. One day Alear had scheduled[AN]
a wedding between her and me.[AN]
[Left]
And what then?[A]
[Right]
She planned to marry me and show off[N]
her newly-controlled Chiki the same[AN]
day. She asked me if there was anyone[N]
from Akaneia I missed. I missed you,[AN]
of course. That got my brain spinning,[N]
and I broke out of my trance just[AN]
before Alear's lackey pronounced me and[N]
her married. I objected, fled back to[AN]
Akaneia, and started looking for you.[N]
And look at what my absence has done...[A]
[Left]
Marth... It's not your fault. I love[N]
you, and I'm so glad you're here.[AN]
Here's what happened to me. I tried[N]
to run Akaneia for a while when you[AN]
first disappeared. Marich and Ellis[N]
were deeply concerned, while Chiki[AN]
was hysterical. I spent as much of[N]
my time as possible looking for you.[AN]
Then Chiki disappeared. At about the[N]
same time, an army officer named[AN]
Kris begun making some outrageous[N]
claims. Apparently he was head of[AN]
the Aritian Royal Guard, but there[N]
is no such unit in the army.[AN]
[Right]
Indeed there isn't. Kris... leader[N]
of the rebels in the civil war.[AN]
Or... the new Emperor of Akaneia.[N]
Is Marich okay?[AN]
[Left]
I couldn't tell you. Anyway, he[N]
claimed to have defended you from[AN]
many assassination attempts, of[N]
which I recall none of them.[AN]
Certainly no assassins followed[N]
us along Anri's Way or attacked[AN]
before Hardin even touched the[N]
Dark Orb. Your "other half"?[A]
[Right]
You're my other half, Sheeda.[N]
Don't let anyone tell you[AN]
otherwise. I do vaguely recall[N]
Jeigan rejecting a recruit by[AN]
the name of Kris. "Horrible[N]
attitude, utterly full of[AN]
himself. Has an unspeakable[N]
charisma; several recruits[AN]
hang on his every word.[N]
Dangerous influence."[AN]
[Left]
He must have gotten into the[N]
army at some point after our[AN]
wedding, and rose up the ranks.[N]
Then word broke of my father's[AN]
death. I made Marich the regent[N]
in the meantime as I returned to[AN]
Talis. Soon after, the civil war[N]
broke out, and Kris has won.[AN]
Kris declared me a traitor,[N]
and now Akaneia is all but his.[AN]
[Right]
Don't worry, Sheeda. We will free[N]
Akaneia from his rule. But where[AN]
do we begin?[AN][X]
