## Ch7OpeningTheNextDay
The next day[X]

## Ch7OpeningWhereIsEveryone
[MR][LoadSheeda]
Morning at last... I can't believe[N]
that actually happened...[AN]
I have to look for other survivors.[N]
I can't see Alear planning this[AN]
wreck: Marth drowning would go against[N]
everything she's aiming for.[AN][X]

## Ch7OpeningFindingMarth
[MR][LoadSheeda]
Marth! Where are you?[N]
Chiki! Are you okay?[AN]
Is anyone out there?[N]
It's me, Sheeda![A]
[ML][LoadMarth]
Nngh...[A]
[MR]
Marth! Is that you? Hold on.[N]
I'm coming to get you![A]
[ML]
Sheeda? If you're here, then[N]
that must mean I'm still alive.[AN]
Are there any other survivors?[A]
[MR]
You're the first I've seen. It's[N]
so cold around here. The average[AN]
person can't be outside here for[N]
very long. I found some ruins[AN]
to take shelter in. You need to[N]
warm up, Marth.[AN]
[ML]
Thanks, Sheeda. Have I ever[N]
told you that I love you?[A]
[MR]
I love you too, Marth.[A][X]

## Ch7OpeningInsideRuins
[MR][LoadMarth][ML][LoadSheeda]
[ML]
Well, I've found some more[N]
survivors, but I haven't[AN]
seen so much as a hint of[N]
the Shield of Seals.[AN]
[MR]
No... The renewed seal on the[N]
Earth Dragons has only been[AN]
present for six years. It won't[N]
be long deteriorating again.[AN]
[ML]
To make matters worse, I haven't[N]
found the Falchion either.[AN]
[MR]
And we haven't found Chiki either.[N]
She spent most of her life asleep[AN]
in the Ice Dragons' Temple, but[N]
prolonged exposure can't be good.[AN]
Sheeda, I'm going out to look for[N]
her. I'll be back as soon as I can.[AN]
[ML]
Be careful out there, Marth.[N]
If you don't find her...[AN]
[MR]
I don't even want to think about[N]
that. I will find Chiki.[A][X]

## Ch7OpeningFindingChiki
[MR][LoadMarth]
Chiki? Where are you?[N]
Are you okay?[AN]
Please, answer me![N]
It's me, Marth![AN]
[ML][LoadChiki]
So... cold... Please...[N]
Someone... Help me...[A]
[MR]
Chiki? Where are you?[N]
I found somewhere safe![A]
[ML]
Marth? I'm... over here...[N]
Hurry... please...[AN]
[MR]
Chiki! Don't worry. I've got[N]
you. Sheeda and the others[AN]
are waiting at some ruins.[N]
We're going to be okay.[AN]
[ML]
Thank you, Marth...[A][X]

## Ch7OpeningSomethingTerrible
[MR][LoadMarth][Left][LoadChiki][FL][LoadSheeda]
[MR]
Well, we've found every survivor[N]
we're going to find. I want[AN]
everyone to make it through, but[N]
sometimes... that's impossible.[AN]
May the fallen rest in peace.[N]
Tomorrow, we march for the Ice[AN]
Dragons' Temple, and ask for Gato's[N]
help. He may be our only hope.[A]
[Left]
I lost my Divine Stone... What can[N]
I even do without it?[AN]
[MR]
Don't be like that, Chiki. I'll[N]
always take care of you.[AN]
It doesn't matter if you've[N]
lost your dragon stone.[A]
[Left]
I feel... like something terrible[N]
just happened. And not just the[AN]
shipwreck... I don't exactly know...[N]
but there's something... wrong...[A]
[FL]
We've lost the Falchion, we've lost[N]
the Shield of Seals, we've lost[AN]
Chiki's dragon stone... None of this[N]
is good. Chiki, do you know what[AN]
these ruins were built for originally?[A]
[Left]
I don't, Sheeda. Maybe Banutu would[N]
know, but he isn't here with us.[AN]
This looks like a giant gate...[N]
If I touch this, what will happen?[A][X]

## Ch7OpeningThroughTheGate
[MR][LoadMarth][Left][LoadChiki][FL][LoadSheeda]
[MR]
What just happened? Chiki, what[N]
did you manage to do?[A]
[FL]
This isn't any ordinary gate...[N]
It feels so powerful.[AN]
[Left]
Are there... voices? I hear voices.[N]
I should cross the gate?[AN]
//Nergal managed to lure Ninian and Nils in somehow in FE7
//Eliwood shouting for help finding Roy here?
[MR]
Chiki, what are you doing?[N]
It might be dangerous![AN]
[Left]
Can Marth cross with me?[N]
[FL]
I don't think she can hear us[N]
right now. We shouldn't[AN]
interrupt her, Marth: the dragons[N]
had some hand in building this.[AN]
[Left]
Okay, I'm going to cross now.[N]
I'm coming to help![A][Clear]
[MR]
Chiki... she's gone! We have to[N]
go after her before the gate[AN]
closes! What just happened to[N]
her?[AN]
[FL]
We can think about that later.[N]
We need to go after Chiki now![A][X]

## Ch7OpeningWelcomeToElibe
[MR][LoadMarth][Left][LoadChiki][FL][LoadSheeda]
[MR]
We're in a different room, and[N]
the gate has closed behind us.[A]
[Left]
...What just happened? Marth, I[N]
heard voices from behind the[AN]
gate, but I don't see anyone here[N]
at all! I'm so confused...[AN]
[FL]
Well, we can't go back outside.[N]
We can stay here, or explore[AN]
these ruins. Maybe we'll find[N]
something useful around?[AN]
[MR]
If we don't search for supplies,[N]
we'll soon end up starving.[AN]
I see light at the bottom of the[N]
stairs. Let's go that way.[A][X]

## Ch7OpeningSteppingOutdoors
[MR][LoadMarth][Left][LoadChiki][FL][LoadSheeda]
It's so much brighter out here.[N]
There's not a snowflake in sight.[AN]
[MR]
Sheeda, Chiki, wherever we are,[N]
I don't think we're in Akaneia...[A]
[Left]
It's still cold, but it's not quite[N]
as cold as the Ice Dragons' Temple.[AN]
The air here feels really strange[N]
too. Just where have we ended up?[AN]
[MR]
That's strange. It feels quite warm[N]
for me and the air's perfectly fine.[AN]
Chiki, do you need a rest?[A]
[Left]
No! I'm alright. I've no idea what's[N]
going on, but I'll be okay.[A]

## Ch7OpeningBanditsLaugh
[ML][LoadFace][0x67][0x01]
//Placeholder for bandit
Did you see that, boys?[N]
I knew staking out the[AN]
Dragons' Gate was a good[N]
idea. Dragons really do[AN]
enter Elibe from here.[N]
And there's only three[AN]
of them, while there's[N]
about thirty of us![AN]
Heheh... Dragons in human[N]
form are helpless.[AN]
If we can ambush them,[N]
their treasure is as[AN]
good as mine. Take 'em[N]
down, boys![A][X]

## Ch7OpeningBanditReaction
[Right][LoadMarth][Left][LoadSheeda][FR][LoadChiki]
[Right]
It looks like we're not getting out[N]
of this without a fight...[AN]
Chiki, get back. You're helpless[N]
on the battlefield without a[AN]
dragon stone. And I've lost the[N]
Falchion and Shield of Seals...[AN]
[Left]
I'm still able to fight. Let's[N]
end this quickly and look for[AN]
anybody who could possibly be[N]
friendly.[A][X]

## Ch7EventEliwoodArrives
[MR][LoadEliwood]
Roy, just where have you disappeared[N]
to? I've combed almost all of Elibe[AN]
trying to find you. If you're not[N]
somewhere on the Dread Isle, there's[AN]
only one possibility left. You couldn't[N]
have passed through the Dragons' Gate.[AN]
...[N]
I don't know who those people are, but[N]
they don't need these brigands harassing[AN]
them. Could they... be dragons? No...[N]
Nils closed the gate behind him.[A][X]

## Ch7EventEliwoodRecruited
[ML][LoadMarth][MR][LoadEliwood]
[MR]
Stay your blade, sir.[N]
I am not your enemy.[AN]
[ML]
I am glad to see an ally[N]
against these brigands.[AN]
Let's work together to[N]
see them defeated.[AN]
[MR]
Indeed. What is your[N]
name, sir?[A]
[ML]
My name is Marth. And[N]
what's your name?[A]
[MR]
Eliwood. Let's talk some[N]
more once we win here.[A]
[ML]
Of course. May fortune[N]
favour you, Eliwood.[A][X]

## Ch7EndingMarthEliwood
[ML][LoadEliwood][MR][LoadMarth]
[MR]
That should be the last of them.[N]
Eliwood, where are we?[A]
[ML]
We're on the Dread Isle, Marth.[N]
Valour, to use its proper name.[A]
[MR]
Dread Isle? I've never heard of[N]
it. Do you live here, Eliwood?[A]
[ML]
No, though I've a long history with[N]
this place. It's been over twenty[AN]
years since I fought Nergal...[N]
Where does the time go?[AN]
Anyway, my son, Roy, disappeared[N]
about a year ago. Ever since,[AN]
Lycia - no, Elibe - has been[N]
growing ever more unstable.[AN]
The Disturbance of Bern only[N]
ended three years ago. The[AN]
last thing Elibe needs is[N]
another war.[AN]
[MR]
I've no fondness for war either.[N]
But... Lycia? Elibe?[AN]
I have no idea where these places[N]
are. I've come from Akaneia.[AN]
It's currently in the throes[N]
of a civil war, its third major[AN]
conflict in the past fifteen years.[N]
I've fled from that war.[AN]
[ML]
You... don't know where Lycia is?[N]
You don't know where Elibe is?![AN]
To be honest, I also have no idea[N]
where Akaneia is. You're standing[AN]
on the continent of Elibe as we[N]
speak. Valour is near Lycia, the[AN]
kingdom I call home. Roy defeated[N]
King Zephiel in the Disturbance[AN]
of Bern, and unified Lycia with[N]
his wife, Lilina. She's trying[AN]
her best to rule on her own, but[N]
Roy vanishing has woken up his[AN]
enemies across the continent.[N]
I've searched everywhere else[AN]
for Roy. My final theory is[N]
he managed to somehow cross[AN]
the Dragons' Gate. But Nils should[N]
have made that impossible...[AN]
[MR]
Dragons' Gate? I did walk through[N]
a gate near the Ice Dragons' Temple.[AN]
Could that be the Dragons' Gate?[AN]
[ML]
...What did you just say?[N]
You... crossed... the Dragons' Gate?[AN]
[MR]
Is that unusual? It's in a very[N]
remote place, I must admit, but-[AN]
[ML]
Marth... I have many questions.[N]
Where do I begin...[AN]
Do you know Nils? He appears to[N]
be a young boy. Light blue hair.[AN]
[MR]
I'm afraid I don't.[A]
[ML]
Hm... Did you know Ninian?[N]
She was his sister... my wife.[AN]
She's... no longer with us.[N]
//I'll stick with convention here
I can only hope she's happy...[AN]
[MR]
My condolences, Eliwood. But I'm[N]
afraid I didn't know her.[A]
[ML]
You crossed the Dragons' Gate...[N]
But you didn't know them...[AN]
Marth. Are you a dragon?[N]
[MR]
No. I am not a dragon. But Chiki?[N]
She is a dragon. A Divine Dragon.[AN]
[MoveRight][FR][LoadChiki]
Hello! So, you're Eliwood? I'm[N]
Chiki. Nice to meet you![A]
[ML]
Nice to meet you too, Chiki.[N]
A dragon crossed through the Dragons'[AN]
gate once more... Marth, is the[N]
pegasus knight a dragon or a human?[AN]
[Right]
Human. That's Sheeda, my wife.[N]
I love her with all my heart.[AN]
[FR][Clear][LoadSheeda]
Hello, Eliwood. My name is Sheeda.[N]
It's a pleasure to meet you.[AN]
[ML]
Indeed it is, Sheeda.[N]
A dragon entering Elibe again...[AN]
And she brought two humans with[N]
her... What is happening?[AN]
Chiki? Marth? Sheeda? I'd like[N]
to extend you all an invitation[AN]
to Ostia, the Lycian capital.[N]
I will introduce you to Queen[AN]
Lilina. We have much to discuss.[N]
Are you all okay with this?[AN]
[Right]
Yes, we'll go. Thank you for[N]
the invitation, Eliwood.[A]
[ML]
The pleasure is mine. Let us[N]
make our way to Ostia.[A][X]

## Ch7EndingSomniel
[Left][LoadAlear][Right][LoadVeyle]
[Right]
Alear, I have some good news, and some[N]
very bad news. What do you want first?[AN]
[Left]
I like good news. Tell me the[N]
good news first, Veyle![A]
[Right]
We've managed to get back some[N]
powerful artefacts. This is[AN]
the Falchion. Didn't Marth try[N]
to kill you with it recently?[AN]
[Left]
Don't remind me... Sheeda has to[N]
be messing with his head![AN]
[Right]
We also found this shield. The[N]
Akaneian Fire Emblem. I've heard[AN]
many rumours about this object.[N]
On one side, it has exceptional[AN]
power. Terrain disadvantages are[N]
gone. Training is vastly more[AN]
effective. Earthquakes can be[N]
summoned forth. Life springs[AN]
eternal. And immunity to harm...[N]
All extremely potent.[A]
[Left]
What's the downside, then?[N]
This all sounds brilliant.[AN]
[Right]
Well, it does drive away the[N]
Akaneian Earth Dragons, and[AN]
let's just say we're a lot[N]
closer to the Earth Dragons[AN]
than we let on to the people[N]
of Elyos. I feel no ill effect[AN]
right now, but if it fell into[N]
enemy hands, I'd be concerned.[AN]
[Left]
Then we just won't let it fall[N]
into enemy hands![AN]
[Right]
The more drastic side effect is[N]
that the Fire Emblem is cursed.[AN]
Apparently its wielders are[N]
doomed to die alone - "the end[AN]
of war, the end of love" is what[N]
is said in Akaneia.[AN]
[Left]
...So if I use it for peace, I can[N]
never see Marth again?[AN]
[Right]
Sister, I'm afraid it's already[N]
too late. You know Marth has used[AN]
the Fire Emblem in battle for years.[N]
If anyone's cursed right now, it's[AN]
actually him. You and Marth may[N]
never be, but there's other men...[AN]
[Left]
Is there... any way to break it?[N]
Has anyone avoided this curse?[AN]
[Right]
If there is a way, nobody I've[N]
talked to has any idea of it.[AN]
[Left]
Marth... No... Are we really...[N]
not meant to be together?[AN]
[Right]
You probably don't want to hear[N]
the bad news, but it must be said.[AN]
After your fight in Talis, Marth[N]
killed Clanne and expelled our[AN]
troops. He then fled to the north.[N]
Louis' fleet pursued him, but a[AN]
storm tore through the battle.[N]
Few from Elyos survived. As for[AN]
Marth, all that remains are the[N]
Falchion and Fire Emblem...[AN]
We found a mysterious stone when[N]
searching the wreckage too.[AN]
[Left]
It's beautiful... Maybe I can use[N]
it in some jewellery?[AN]
But is Marth really dead? He can't[N]
have just died in a storm![AN]
[Right]
There was no body. But the water[N]
was bitterly cold. He almost[AN]
certainly died of exposure.[N]
It took several days to find[AN]
his possessions. Alear, you're[N]
going to have to move on.[AN]
[Left]
Move on... Veyle... Sniff...[N]
I'll tell Framme about Clanne.[AN]
And then... I'll have to...[N]
move on... Marth...[AN]
[FR][LoadVander]
Divine One! Lady Veyle![N]
King Diamant of Brodia[AN]
is here to see you.[N]
He says it's urgent.[AN]
[Left]
...Let him in.[A]
[FR][Clear][LoadDiamant]
The preperations for Elibe are[N]
complete. Shall we begin?[AN]
[Left]
Of course.[A][X]
