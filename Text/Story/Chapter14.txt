## Ch14WorldMap
In the year 606 by Akaneian reckoning,[N]
King Lima IV was killed in a coup by[AN]
General Dozer, with Rigelian backing.[AN]
Alm, seemingly an ordinary country man,[N]
joined the liberation against Dozer,[AN]
and soon took the war directly to Rigel.[AN]
Yet as Emperor Rudolf was cut down, he[N]
revealed the truth: Alm was his son,[AN]
prince of Rigel. His childhood friend[N]
Celica, in truth Princess Anteze of[AN]
Sofia, was also fighting a war against[N]
the Doma Faithful, the Rigelian faith.[AN]
Together, they slew Doma and married[N]
soon afterwards.[AN]
Rudolf's gambit was a success: the gods[N]
were dead and Valencia was unified.[AN]
What wasn't common knowledge was that[N]
Doma and Mila both were Divine Dragons...[AN]
Doma had degenerated, and Mila was[N]
starting to go when Rudolf killed her.[AN]
A stable and peaceful realm has now[N]
had that peace disturbed.[AN]
Alm and Celica balanced each other out.[N]
What will happen with that balance broken?[A][X]

## Ch14OpeningOnTheRoad
[FL][LoadChiki][Left][LoadMarth][Right][LoadSheeda][FR][LoadValbo]
We're coming up on Grove Village.[N]
That's a good place to rest.[AN]
It's roughly about halfway to[N]
Sofia Castle: the capital.[A]
[Left]
So, how exactly did Valencia unite?[N]
I know that it did, but not how.[AN]
[FR]
Well, about a decade ago there was[N]
a huge famine. Nothing was growing.[AN]
Pirates were everywhere. One pack of[N]
'em killed my family. So I hired[AN]
some mercenaries to get my revenge.[N]
Ran into Celica the same day.[AN]
She helped me, so I helped her for[N]
the rest of the war. Boats, sand,[AN]
swamps, and a lot of bandits,[N]
monsters, and cultists.[AN]
At the end, we had our backs to the[N]
wall as Celica fought until the end.[AN]
//Do not trust in Falchion. Celica does not die.
And then Alm showed up in the nick of[N]
time and killed Doma, the Evil God.[AN]
[FL]
What made him so evil? Why[N]
would anyone worship him?[AN]
[FR]
Well, "evil" is a harsh title.[N]
Emperor Alm inherited his disdain[AN]
of divinity from his father and,[N]
with the gods purged, now wants[AN]
nothing more for mankind to be the[N]
masters of their own fate.[AN]
Doesn't stop the people from saying[N]
Celica's Mila reborn, though...[AN]
[FL]
But I'm a Divine Dragon. Does that[N]
mean he wants to purge me too?[AN]
Sniff... Why can't we all just get[N]
along? This Alm sounds mean![AN]
[Left]
Hm... Now you've made Chiki cry.[N]
Leaving dragon politics aside,[AN]
how was Valencia before Celica[N]
disappeared? I have a hunch[AN]
as to who may have caused this.[A]
[FR]
Piracy along the east coast is[N]
still a problem, but aside from[AN]
that, Valencia was perfectly at[N]
peace. Now the Doma Faithful[AN]
are back. They got merged into[N]
the Mila Faithful a while back,[AN]
but that was never very popular.[N]
Now Judah's diehards are starting[AN]
to cause trouble again. I hope[N]
that Celica comes back soon...[A][X]

## Ch14OpeningClaireFrets
//Claire, Engage boss (Etie)
[ML][LoadClaire][MR][LoadEtie]
Oh, I can't believe it. The[N]
floodgate's been sabotaged![AN]
Valbo's gone missing! Are we[N]
truly under attack?[AN]
An army has appeared to our[N]
south, and it's not ours.[AN]
[MR]
Didn't you hear Celica? The[N]
Akaneians are up to no good![AN]
[ML]
And the Akaneians being up to[N]
no good makes no sense?[AN]
Do you think Kris is going to[N]
declare war on Valencia?[AN]
[MR]
Claire, right? I think that's[N]
your name. It appears your[AN]
lack of muscles is getting to[N]
your brain. We're going in.[AN]
Akaneia is a threat. We're[N]
going to have a fleet attack[AN]
Grunia within the month.[N]
They're all so weak. Ha ha ha![AN]
[ML]
War with Akaneia?! Insane! I'd[N]
have heard about such a plan.[AN]
This is my unit, and my orders[N]
are to hold position for now.[AN]
I've got a report to make: know[N]
your place, soldier![A][X]

## Ch14OpeningEtieTakesOver
[MR][LoadEtie]
So, that snob's flown off. Phew.[N]
I'd hurl if I had to put up with[AN]
her for one second longer. Her[N]
head is the opposite of her muscle.[AN]
Alfred would have wanted eternal[N]
muscle. Strength above all![AN]
[ML][LoadFace][0x6B][0x01]
//red soldier
Dame Etie, about the nearby army...[N]
Should we let it pass ahead?[AN]
I believe Sir Valbo is moving[N]
a unit towards the capital.[AN]
[MR]
Oh. Well, Claire's gone. You know[N]
what the Divine One wants?[AN]
[ML]
Infinite muscles?[A]
[MR]
I wish! She wants the Emblems[N]
back. She's lost a lot lately.[AN]
And Marth has landed here.[N]
We must recapture him![AN]
All units, attack the passing[N]
army! Don't let them get away![AN]
[ML]
But Dame Claire outranks you.[N]
You can't give that order.[AN]
[MR]
So? I can take care of her. My[N]
muscles are the finest in Firene![A][X]

## Ch14AfterPrepRoutEm
[ML][LoadMarth][MR][LoadValbo]
Why are we under attack?[N]
What is Dame Claire doing?[AN]
[ML]
Some of those soldiers... I[N]
think there's Elyians here.[AN]
Loyal to Alear, not Alm...[N]
We must defend ourselves.[A][X]

## Ch14Village1
[ML][LoadFace][0x64][0x01][MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML]
So the emperor's started a[N]
recruitment drive recently.[AN]
There's a lot of new soldiers[N]
around here recently.[AN]
The leader of them is a giant[N]
musclehead. She won't shut up[AN]
about how strong or weak we[N]
are. It's extremely grating.[AN]
Here, how about you take this?[N]
I think she's with the Doma[AN]
Faithful: we'd be better off[N]
if she went and disappeared...[A][X]

## Ch14House1
[ML][LoadFace][0x64][0x01][MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML]
So I heard the floodgate has been[N]
opened again. Now, we're not in[AN]
imminent danger of flooding, but[N]
that is not good news at all.[AN]
It's meant to be open enough to[N]
have a controlled flow between[AN]
west and east, yet I hear someone[N]
flew in and demanded it open![AN]
Technically royal authority is[N]
needed: I'm sure that was gotten[AN]
around somehow. This is a very[N]
concerning development...[A][X]

## Ch14House2
[ML][LoadFace][0x64][0x01][MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML]
We're preparing for war, aren't we?[N]
Normally Empress Celica would be[AN]
fiercely against such brazen moves.[N]
But ever since she returned, she's[AN]
just egging Alm on! The last thing[N]
we need is to have Rigel drag us[AN]
into a war against a whole continent![N]
If Alm attacks Kris, we are doomed.[AN]
Even the scattered anti-Kris factions[N]
would threaten us. Oh, how I miss[AN]
the old days... Mila, please help us![N]
Return to Sofia in her hour of need![A][X]

## Ch14House3
[ML][LoadFace][0x64][0x01][MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML]
Are you with Sofia? No? Excellent.[N]
Doma's destruction has left us[AN]
bereft of any leadership. How is[N]
he meant to help us if he's dead?[AN]
I've travelled south from Rigel[N]
in order to see Mila's Temple for[AN]
myself, but by all accounts she's[N]
been swept aside too! She may have[AN]
been a weakening force, but she at[N]
least provided some guidance.[AN]
Now we're left with a void. Mankind[N]
is not capable of determining its[AN]
own fate. But I don't agree with[N]
Judah's philosophy either.[AN]
I don't like Alm, but I'd take him[N]
any day of the week.[AN][X]

## Ch14AdultDoot
[ML][LoadDyute][MR][LoadCurrent]
//Dyute
[ML]
What's going on here? I visit[N]
home for the first time in a[AN]
while only to find my brother[N]
has gone ahead and disappeared![AN]
Why isn't he home? He could[N]
have at least left a letter...[AN]
Oh, Ryuto. You've probably run[N]
off with the cats![AN]
Wait, was someone there? Sorry.[N]
My name's Dyute. I could be[AN]
the best mage ever if I wanted,[N]
but actually applying myself is[AN]
oh so boring. Swinging swords[N]
around is a lot more fun.[AN]
Variety is the spice of life,[N]
so how about you watch me go?[A][X]

## Ch14EndingWhatDidSheDo
[MR][LoadClaire]
//Claire
What was I thinking? Not only[N]
did that fool Etie blatantly[AN]
disobey my orders, she attacked[N]
that passing army![AN]
Now my unit has been routed.[N]
This is a complete disaster![AN]
Was Celica right? I saw a dragon.[N]
Is Akaneia attacking us?[AN][X]

## Ch14EndingNotAllValencian
[ML][LoadMarth][MR][LoadValbo]
It's done... We have routed this[N]
division. Everyone has Valencian[AN]
uniform, but I don't recognise[N]
the commander at all.[AN]
[ML]
She's not Valencian. If memory[N]
serves, that's Etie, from Firene.[AN]
Her one true love was the muscle.[N]
And with her death, we have proof[AN]
that Alear has infiltrated Valencia.[N]
It appears she has a different[AN]
strategy this time, with there being[N]
fewer factions on Valencia...[A]
[MR]
Emperor Marth, what is this Alear's[N]
ultimate objective?[AN]
[ML]
Gather the Twelve Emblems in[N]
physical form. From there,[AN]
I do not exactly know...[N]
I doubt it's anything good.[AN]
[MR]
So, what exactly is an Emblem?[N]
What do they do?[AN][X]
//Explaination off-screened

## Ch14EndingWeMustSaveCelica
[ML][LoadMarth][MR][LoadValbo]
...That's... what?[N]
So someone from who-knows-where[AN]
just kidnapped Celica because[N]
she resembles some ghost she[AN]
fought a war with however long[N]
ago? That makes no sense![AN]
[ML]
I never said Alear makes sense.[N]
We need to save Celica.[AN]
And we need to get to Alm.[N]
We absolutely must avoid a war![A][X]

## Ch14ClaireReportsIn
[Left][LoadClaire][Right][LoadAlm][FR][LoadCeline]
Your majesty! I don't know what[N]
happened in Grove Village, but[AN]
my unit was completely routed![N]
First, the floodgate has been[AN]
sabotaged. I'm not sure by who,[N]
and we have a few months to fix it.[AN]
[FR]
...Sabotage? I suppose so...[N]
Ahem. We should find who the[AN]
saboteur is, then. Destruction[N]
of national infrastructure...[AN]
That's... that's unacceptable.[N]
Please continue, Claire.[AN]
[Left]
Of course. I believe Valbo noticed[N]
this sabotage and is moving to[AN]
inform us of this in person.[N]
But since he neglected to inform[AN]
anyone of his army's movement,[N]
he passed south of Grove Village.[AN]
I went on a reconnaissance flight[N]
with orders not to engage, but[AN]
Etie blatantly ignored them and[N]
attacked anyway.[AN]
[FR]
Why? Who was in the enemy army?[N]
What was her insurbordination for?[AN]
[Left]
I was watching from afar,[N]
so take this with a pinch of salt.[AN]
But I am sure that I saw Emperor[N]
Marth of Akaneia in the flesh.[AN]
Emperor Kris is lying: he's not[N]
in Lythos with Alear.[AN]
[FR]
[ToggleMouthMove](So, Claire figured it out.[N]
My whole plan is a pile of lies.[AN]
But I have to keep going.[N]
For the Divine One. For Firene.)[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
[Right]
Celica, are you alright?[N]
You're sweating...[AN]
[FR]
No... I'm fine. Claire.[N]
Finish your report.[AN]
[Left]
So there were Akaneians,[N]
but that purple banner[AN]
Valbo mentioned earlier[N]
was there too. Marth[AN]
may have made a foreign[N]
alliance somewhere.[AN]
[FR]
[ToggleMouthMove](Lycia... Diamant destroyed[N]
Elibe in securing Roy.[AN]
Will I destroy Valencia to[N]
secure Celica, all while[AN]
I impersonate her? If Alm[N]
ever learns the truth...)[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
[Left]
Most importantly, there was[N]
a dragon. A living one.[AN]
[Right]
A dragon? A living dragon?[N]
Did I hear that right?[AN]
[Left]
It appeared attuned to ice,[N]
but I cannot tell for sure...[AN]
[FR]
[ToggleMouthMove](I have to. If I betray Alear...[N]
what of Firene?)[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
Alm, I heard about this while I[N]
was imprisoned by the Aritians.[AN]
Where you see Marth, you will[N]
often see a young girl nearby.[AN]
Her name is Chiki. She looks like[N]
a sweet, innocent, little girl.[AN]
But those looks are incredibly[N]
deceiving, a pure disguise.[AN]
Her true form is that of a golden[N]
dragon, but she can shapeshift.[AN]
[Right]
So Marth has brought a living[N]
dragon to Valencia. Continue.[AN]
[FR]
Dragon zombies are dangerous, but[N]
when alive, they are far stronger.[AN]
There is no protection from a[N]
dragon's breath. Only the strongest[AN]
weapons can pierce their scales.[N]
And they attack without mercy.[AN]
[Right]
Such a terrible creature. Feigning[N]
humanity? For what purpose?[AN]
[FR]
Alm... this is the worst part. I[N]
learned a terrible secret in[AN]
the Aritian prison camps. Doma?[N]
Mila? They were Divine Dragons.[AN]
And guess what? So is Chiki.[N]
She is the same species as Doma.[AN]
[Right]
...Celica... Please tell me you're[N]
joking. All that work to kill Doma...[AN]
[FR]
I wish I was. Marth has brought a[N]
stronger Doma to Valencia.[AN]
[Right]
Alright, that's it. Thank you for[N]
telling me this, Claire.[AN]
So, Marth really is attacking us.[N]
He's trying to undo my life's work.[AN]
Well, Mr. Lowell, you have crossed[N]
Albyne Alm Rudolf. Big mistake.[A][X]
