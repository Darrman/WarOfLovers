## LethalWorldMap
The universe is an unfathomably large[N]
place. Galaxies, stars, planets...[AN]
This tale will span a multitude of them.[N]
But all must start somewhere, and that[AN]
somewhere is Ireland, a small island nation[N]
located off the continent of Europe,[AN]
in turn located on Planet Earth, the Milky Way.[N]
Following in a long series of events involving[AN]
evening train crashes and encounters with many[N]
powerful figures the native Earthlings had long[AN]
considered to be fictional, a certain group of[N]
battle-hardened veterans had victory in sight.[AN]
Mario Mario and his army had reconstructed the[N]
fabled "Derry Road", destroyed sixty years prior,[AN]
undoing the damage of the Benson Report. Yet he[N]
stands revived, along with his southern[AN]
counterpart Andrews, on the orders of Ridley,[N]
leader of the Space Pirates.[AN]
With a miracluous recovery of long-vanished[N]
rolling stock, Mario set course for Derry.[AN]
It was a fateful July evening, as the two sides[N]
finally came to a head...[A][X]

//MARIO:
[Right]
So, it's a finally happening![N]
All we need to do is climb[AN]
onto the walls of Derry and[N]
we can finally go home again![AN]
//PEACH:
[Left]
I'm sure Fawful and his friends[N]
won't let us near the Arch.[AN]
Once we arrive, we are going to[N]
have to fight our way across.[AN]
//LUIGI:
[FR]
There's hundreds of people on[N]
this train, and they're all[AN]
with us! Quite a long way from[N]
when we first started, eh?[AN]
//TOAD:
[FL]
Wow, we put a whole lot of time[N]
into this, but it really did pay[AN]
off. It's a good thing we ran[N]
into (BUILDERS) when we did![AN]
//Probably credit the time-stopping and space-warping Touhous
//MARIO:
[Right]
I haven't thanked them enough.[N]
Otherwise, we'd be a walking[AN]
for days, and we'd be worn out[N]
before ever arriving at Derry![A][X]

## LethalObligatoryETCBanterFE
//Eight coaches, eight scenes?
[FL][LoadLana][Left][LoadCelice][MR][LoadSigurd]
//SIGURD:
So we've been across this whole[N]
country, fighting foes from Jugdral[AN]
and beyond, evading the authorities[N]
from both sides of the border...[AN]
It brings back unpleasant memories.[N]
But it will all come to an end.[AN]
//CELICE:
[Left]
... ... ...[A]
//SIGURD:
[MR]
This Arch of Coups clearly has some[N]
power over time and space.[AN]
My son is grown, married even.[N]
I have defeated Alvis once[AN]
and for all. Who is left to[N]
threaten Jugdral's peace?[AN]
//LANA:
[FL]
Julia told me about Archbishop[N]
Manfloy pulling the strings[AN]
in the background in your time.[N]
I think he's still out there.[AN]
The Lopt Sect have to be in with[N]
the Space Pirates.[AN]
//SIGURD:
[MR]
You're right, Lana. If we kill[N]
him, maybe the rearrangement[AN]
will bring me and Deirdre back[N]
together again...[A][X]

## LethalObligatoryETCBanterYGO
[FL][LoadTea][Left][LoadYugi][Right][LoadJoey]
[Left]
//YUGI:
Alright, I'll start.[N]
Draw![A]
//TEA:
[FL]
Yugi, didn't they change that[N]
rule a few years ago?[AN]
//YUGI:
[Left]
We're playing Time Wizard rules,[N]
Tea. We can play whatever format[AN]
we want. And that means playing[N]
Battle City rules![AN]
//JOEY:
[Right]
Exactly! The Duel Monsters of[N]
today is completely different.[AN]
I'm not sure if you could say[N]
it's even the same game.[A]
//TEA:
[FL]
Well, I'm not going to stop you.[N]
Have fun, you two![AN]
//YUGI:
[Left]
Now, I summon Giant Soldier of Stone[N]
in defence mode, set two cards face-[AN]
down, and I end my turn.[N]
//JOEY:
[Right]
My turn! Draw! Now the first thing[N]
I'll do is activate Pot of Greed![AN]
That lets me draw two more cards![N]
Now I summon Baby Dragon![AN]
//KAIBA:
[FR][LoadKaiba]
This duel should have ended by now![N]
Can either of you at least try to[AN]
synchro summon a monster? All you[N]
need to do is learn how to add.[A]
//TEA:
[FL]
Do you have to interrupt this duel?[N]
Synchro monsters didn't exist back[AN]
in Battle City. Now that I think of[N]
it, Yugi did say some time traveller[AN]
fought with him against another one[N]
using synchros...[AN]
//KAIBA:
[FR]
Time travelling? Preposterous! There[N]
has to be a scientific explanation.[A]
//YUGI:
[Left]
There are many mages on this train,[N]
Kaiba. Magic very clearly exists...[A][X]

## LethalObligatoryETCBanterFF

//CECIL:
Are you saying this actually happens?[N]
That sounds so repetitive![AN]
//KAIN:
[Right]
Well, he wouldn't shut up about how[N]
these "After Years" went down.[AN]
Most of it was our quest except a[N]
bit different and with your son,[AN]
but at the end things got crazy.[N]
Where do I even begin...[AN]
//RYDIA:
[FL][LoadRydia]
Oh, you're talking about that again?[N]
Why did the aliens look like me?[AN]
//KAIN:
[Right]
I don't think they ever explain...[N]
Anyway, some bigger alien called[AN]
"the creator" had destroyed every[N]
other early Final Fantasy world.[AN]
//CECIL:
[Left]
Why? What do Butz and Terra have to[N]
do with us? They had their own[AN]
adventures. And this sequel just[N]
indirectly lets Kefka win?[AN]
//RYDIA:
[FL]
Is this game at least fun? That[N]
doesn't stop that story from[AN]
being awful! Do things get better?[N]
And not just for us![AN]
//KAIN:
[Right]
I don't think they do. If a second[N]
moon ever appears, let's make sure[AN]
none of these After Years events[N]
ever end up happening![AN]
//CECIL:
[Left]
Agreed. I'm giving the others a tip-[N]
off, too. Just to be safe.[A][X]

//Four more, but I'll leave those for later.
//ETC/AOC appearances not needed: use for WOL asset creation!

## LethalReturnToFoyleRoad
//LOCAL:
Wait a minute, I thought that track[N]
was old and disused and three foot.[AN]
Why exactly is a (LOCO TYPE HERE)[N]
running into an intact Foyle Road?[AN]
//MARIO:
Wahoo! We've made it! I've reached[N]
my destination at last![AN]
//LOCAL:
But this building wasn't here[N]
yesterday. Or this track.[AN]
And there's hundreds of people[N]
just getting off.[AN]
//SIGURD:
We met some extremely powerful[N]
people. Now where is the Arch[AN]
of Coups? Mario claims that it's[N]
in this city somehow...[AN]
//LOCAL:
There's no gate by that name.[N]
I wouldn't go on the walls[AN]
today, there's a parade on...[N]
How about you wait a bit?[AN]
//MARIO:
But if we wait, we won't get home[N]
and Fawful will win![AN]
Look, I see a big wall over there.[N]
Maybe the Arch is this a way![A][X]

## LethalLogQuota1
12/08/765 (Jugdral calendar)[N]
Whatever went wrong in Derry[N]
went very, very wrong.[AN]
Not quite sure what happened.[N]
I've been out cold for a month,[N]
give or take a few days.[AN]
I'm working for this company now,[N]
and I'm not sure for how long.[N]
I need to find 100 gold of scrap.[AN]
There's three others with me, and[N]
I don't know any of them.[N]
I have no choice but to work...[A][X]

## LethalLogQuota2
16/08/765[N]
We explored a moon named[N]
Experimentation.[AN]
It clearly hasn't been inhabited[N]
by humans in a long time: all[N]
that's to be found are spiders.[AN]
There's a disused railway line[N]
in front of the facility too.[N]
I do want to know something:[AN]
what exactly was the experiment[N]
taking place here? The rest of[N]
the crew didn't really care.[A][X]

## LethalLogQuota3
21/08/765[N]
The company doesn't give any rest.[N]
A doubled quota and away we go.[AN]
Vow's main features include the[N]
dangerous bridge, the twisting caves,[N]
and the dangerous monsters.[AN]
This company doesn't supply us with[N]
any means of defence beyond shovels.[N]
I do wonder how magic would work...[AN]
Regardless, I will make a vow here:[N]
I will return to Jugdral. I will[N]
find Deirdre and Celice once again.[A][X]

## LethalLogQuota4
22/08/765[N]
A tragedy has occurred today. The[N]
weather is severe and the way to[AN]
the fire exit had flooded. One of[N]
the crew had found a lot of scrap,[N]
only for the bridge to collapse.[AN]
There was no chance of survival[N]
and we couldn't retrieve the body.[N]
I didn't even know his name.[AN]
I'm fixing that with the rest of[N]
the crew tonight. I can't make it[N]
back home without some help.[A][X]

## LethalLogQuota5
28/08/765[N]
We're marching ever further into[N]
danger, but also into profit.[AN]
March is a foggy place, and I nearly[N]
fell into the lake near our ship.[N]
Of course, Mima just laughed at me.[AN]
Inside, Shirou got hit by a thumper,[N]
but he managed to limp his way out.[N]
The company sent a new crewmate too.[AN]
Her name's Hornet: she certainly has[N]
no fear of the insects of this system.[N]
But we're reaching the limits of four.[A][X]

## LethalLogQuota6
01/09/765[N]
I'm completely frozen. Take Silesia,[N]
make it twice as cold, and you get Rend.[AN]
Regulations say only four are allowed[N]
at once on a ship. But they clearly have[N]
more employees than that. Hm.[AN]
Speaking of, I thought another group[N]
arrived with us on the same day.[N]
Then I saw that ghastly mask...[AN]
What's going on here? I will get home,[N]
even if I have to rend the heads from[N]
the company's shoulders![A][X]

## LethalLogQuota7
07/09/765[N]
Everyone else is off to Titan.[N]
But not me. I'm staying on Gordion.[AN]
That tentacle monster is sinister.[N]
I need more allies. I've not seen[N]
a truly living company employee...[AN]
If all goes well, I'll find some[N]
allies to fly back to Jugdral.[N]
Even help on these quotas will[AN]
go a long, long way. Shirou thinks[N]
this is a terrible idea, but I will[N]
always do what I think is right.[A][X]

## LethalLogQuota8
11/09/140 (Gensokyo calendar)[N]
Sigurd said he'd be waiting,[N]
but was he? No.[AN]
I can only assume some youkai or[N]
another made him her dinner while[N]
we were climbing that skyscraper.[AN]
The company replaced him with this[N]
Mario character. He volunteered his[N]
name immediately.[AN]
Something about peaches or browsers...[N]
I wasn't really listening. Anyway,[N]
Titan is a titan of profit![A][X]

## LethalLogQuota9
15/09/2025[N]
This quota is dizzyingly high.[N]
Three thousand geo? A bar of[AN]
solid gold is only worth 200.[N]
Then again, Hallownest and the[N]
Company are completely different.[AN]
I think we can survive this week,[N]
but next... We all got lost in[N]
Titan's tunnels. Mario jumped[AN]
his way out, Mima floated off,[N]
and Shirou just hid in the ship.[N]
You don't have a sabre...[A][X]

## LethalLogQuota10
23/09/765[N]
I have a lot of very important[N]
things to tell you.[AN]
I found a safe place to hide - I[N]
can't write it down for obvious[N]
reasons.[AN]
But I sat myself down and saw[N]
behind the curtain. I saw several[N]
other employees of the Company.[AN]
All of them were fulfilling quotas,[N]
just like us. No sign of management.[N]
All of them mourning missing crew.[AN]
And then, I saw a door open. Actual[N]
management! And a new hire. She was[N]
really quite confused about things.[AN]
I asked about what was going on, but[N]
he assumed I was a new employee and[N]
ignored me. Sigurd Chalphy was[AN]
missing, along with (DEAD GUY) - so[N]
that was his name. One mystery[N]
finally solved, at least. Zigludo[AN]
the new recruit, however, flew off[N]
to Adamance. And on Adamance is the[N]
route to Artifice.[AN]
I've gotten some help from the[N]
other crews. (POKEMON) can win a[N]
fight with any monster.[AN]
The Emerald Herald will serve as[N]
mission control. (PLACEHOLDER FOR[N]
DEAD MAN WALKING DESCRIPTION)[AN]
And Enteh - the new hire - is a[N]
shaman, so she can heal our wounds[N]
if we can find a staff.[AN]
I see Mario Mario's made his way[N]
onto this crew somehow as well.[N]
So, there are more Derry survivors.[AN]
That makes nine of us aboard.[N]
Tomorrow, we set off for Artifice.[N]
This will all come to a conclusion.[A][X]
