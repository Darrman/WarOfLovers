## SHPCPrelude
# The premise is grand RPG crossover, FE4-style. 
# NARRATOR:
Welcome. The tale you are about to witness[N]
is a tale of grand ambition, entailing many[AN]
different countries. To introduce them all[N]
now would take far too long. This is a story[AN]
of heroes, of grand schemes, of success and[N]
failure. A saga spanning generations.[AN]
Well, good listener? I don't know your name.[N]
Please, could you tell me?[A][X]

## SHPCPostNameEntry
[MR][LoadPlayer][ML][LoadNarrator]
# NARRATOR:
So your name is [Tact]? I see.[N]
Your role in the story is to[AN]
listen to me. Yes, I know[N]
traditionally the player names[AN]
the hero. Light Warrior [Tact]![N]
[Tact], descendant of Erdrick![AN]
Actually, Erdrick's birth name[N]
is [Tact] as well! So you do not[AN]
get to name any characters.[N]
Now without further ado...[AN]
[Red]The Final Fantasy[Red][A][X]

## SHPCFF1Opening
The world is veiled in darkness.[N]
The wind stops, the sea is wild,[N]
and the earth begins to rot.[AN]
The people wait, their only hope,[N]
a prophecy...[AN]
"When the world is in darkness[N]
Four Warriors will come..."[AN]
After a long journey,[N]
four young warriors arrive,[N]
each holding an ORB.[A][X]

It was when I departed with[N]

descend from? If you get[N]
what I'm trying to imply.[A]
[Right]
# HERO:
Who else? Ah, of course. I shall[N]
phrase it as such.[AN]

My name's Alena. I was fighting[N]
this monster, Balzack, who had[AN]
taken over Santeem. Mara and Nara[N]
especially wanted their revenge...[AN]
But we couldn't defeat him and we[N]

that so-called hero. And he's[N]
brought a whole army with him![AN]

brought light to Alefgard for[N]
the first time.[AN]

I've never heard of any of these,[N]
but at the same time I feel[AN]

# FIGHTER:
Hmm... Zoma... Necrosaro... The[N]
Emperor... Chaos...[AN]

now, and cast you down[N]

And then the brave Erdrick struck[N]
down Baramos. Aliahan would[AN]

# BANUTU:
It is the only way to avoid[N]
degeneration into a mindless[AN]

contemptious of humans...[AN]
And so the Gaia inevitably[N]
succumbed to degeneration.[AN]
Most of the Basilisk - Demon[N]

Correct. The Salamander - Fire[N]

Degeneration cannot be cured.[AN]

Anyway, humanity soon turned[AN]

shall heal given time. But if[N]
the strongest of all revival[AN]
magic is failing... We must[N]
not delay any further![AN]

# FIGHTER:

Our objective is clear: we[N]
charge into Eureka, gather[AN]
the strongest weapons, and[N]
take the fight to Chaos![A][X]

## SHPCMediuthBlocksResurrection
# MEDIUTH:
This... it wasn't perfect, but[N]
it's not far off at all.[A]
# NECROSARO:
Mediuth, what did you manage[N]
to pull off?[A]
# MEDIUTH:
Back in Durhua, it takes a massive[N]
amount of energy to revive the dead.[AN]
But everywhere else, it is trivial.[N]
So if I managed to harness enough[AN]
energy, I could impose my native rules[N]
on this tower.[AN]
# NECROSARO:
Very interesting. Does it only work[N]
on humans, or is it universal?[AN]
# MEDIUTH:
Universal. I'd love to see humanity[N]
get a taste of their own medicine,[AN]
but I can't exclusively seal off[N]
enemy resurrection spells.[AN]
# NECROSARO:
A shame... Perhaps there would be[N]
another way if we could revive.[AN]
Only divine intervention could[N]
bring Rosa back, and the gods[AN]
are not on our side. Evolution[N]
it is, then.[AN]
# CHAOS:
Hm... Mediuth, can you toggle your[N]
resurrection blocker? I could[AN]
try to revive the Four Fiends.[N]
Once they're back, turn it back on.[AN]
# MEDIUTH:
...It's permanent. It may be proximity[N]
based, in which case I could wait in[AN]
the Dark World, but otherwise, it's[N]
tied to my own life.[AN]
# CHAOS:
Unfortunate. Still, I saw the Light[N]
Warriors at the Dragon Warrior's[AN]
throat. Most of their resurrection[N]
spells doing absolutely nothing,[AN]
and their absolute strongest only[N]
partially reviving the dead?[AN]
# NECROSARO:
Oh, watching them fumble over[N]
themselves as their Vivifies[AN]
kept failing to revive that fool[N]
Alena... Oh, you were that close[AN]
to getting rid of one of those[N]
stupid chosen ones forever![AN]
Still, if she's a mindless zombie[N]
now, I thank you, Mediuth.[AN]
# MEDIUTH:
Apparently that Alis was a princess[N]
all along. I'll need a word with[AN]
Lassic about that one: I know Sheeda[N]
is and Alena was useless with magic.[AN]
If I knew Alis could use Ohm too,[N]
I'd have factored that in![AN]
# LASSIC:
What's this about Alis?! Bah, I[N]
knew I should have had her shot[AN]
too when I had the chance. Oh,[N]
good day, Mediuth, Necrosaro.[AN]
Don't you think we should move?[N]
I fear we may be found here![AN]
# NECROSARO:
You're still just a cowardly human.[N]
Powerful, but nothing more.[AN]
If you had told us about Alis,[N]
we may have prepared for this.[AN]
There's a queue for evolution,[N]
and remember I discovered the[AN]
Secret of Evolution! Lassic,[N]
you're going to have to wait.[AN]
# LASSIC:
Please, I'm just an old man.[N]
I need this power the most![AN]
Wait! Where are you going?[N]
Don't leave me behind![A][X]

## SHPCMariaFirion
[ML][LoadMaria][MR][LoadFirion]
Maria, we're almost done.[N]
The Emperor is somewhere[AN]
in this tower - hopefully,[N]
this will be the end.[AN]
[ML]
This will be the third time[N]
we've fought the Emperor.[AN]
We have to stop him now.[N]
Otherwise, he'll unleash[AN]
another whirlwind, and[N]
destroy the whole world![AN]
[MR]
We cannot allow that to[N]
happen. We will stop the[AN]
Emperor together, and then[N]
Phin will finally be safe.[AN][X]

## SHPCMariaGuy
[ML][LoadMaria][MR][LoadGuy]
[ML]
Guy, the monsters here are[N]
very dangerous.[AN]
We need to try to dodge[N]
anyone who attacks us.[AN]
[MR]
Yes. I talked to the[N]
beavers outside.[AN]
They said many evil men[N]
live in this tower.[AN]
[ML]
Well for the sake of the[N]
beavers, Phin, and[AN]
everyone else, we must[N]
win this battle today![A][X]

## SHPCMariaBritish
[ML][LoadMaria][MR][LoadBritish]
So, thou art the one who[N]
summoned me here...[AN]
The magic of Ultima has[N]
many effects.[AN]
[ML]
They say Ultima gets[N]
stronger with[AN]
mastery of magic, but[N]
it just... doesn't.[AN]
The legends, the blood[N]
shed for this spell...[AN]
[MR]
Its damage may be[N]
disappointing,[AN]
but I can teach[N]
thee more about[AN]
Ultima if thou[N]
art interested.[AN]
[ML]
Very well, Lord British.[N]
Tell me more.[A][X]

## SHPCSoldierErdrick
[ML][LoadSoldier][MR][LoadErdrick]
Hey, Soldier. So I've been[N]
thinking about things...[AN]
Being swept up in this[N]
world-spanning quest...[AN]
Fighting alongside my own[N]
descendants...[AN]
[ML]
Your own descendants...[N]
Arus, what do you mean?[AN]
What do I have to do[N]
with your descendants?[AN]
[MR]
What I'm trying to say[N]
is I love you, Soldier.[A]
[ML]
...I love you too.[A][X]

## SHPCSoldierHero
[ML][LoadSoldier][MR][LoadHero]
So, thou art a companion[N]
of Erdrick himself.[AN]
Thy strength is tremendous.[N]
I have great respect.[AN]
[ML]
Really, now? Do you want[N]
to test your strength[AN]
against me? Let's see if[N]
you really are as strong[AN]
as the man you claim to[N]
be your ancestor![AN]
[MR]
...Very impressive. Thou[N]
art stronger than I.[AN]
Thy magic is nil, but[N]
dost thou need it?[AN]
[ML]
You do take after Arus...[N]
A bit of Priest too...[AN]
Let's put Zoma back in[N]
the ground together![A][X]

## SHPCSoldierFirion
[ML][LoadSoldier][MR][LoadFirion]
[ML]
Hey, Firion. I have a[N]
question for you.[AN]
Did you really train[N]
by getting beaten up?[AN]
[MR]
It wasn't my go-to, but[N]
the answer is yes.[AN]
It's a bit dishonest, but[N]
I can prepare to attack,[AN]
but then do something[N]
else. Good practice![AN]
[ML]
Everyone else I know[N]
just fights monsters.[AN]
But you can parry an[N]
attack, stop parrying,[AN]
and still take less[N]
damage from monsters...[A]
[MR]
Soldier, we should[N]
study these techniques[AN]
in more detail some[N]
day. Interesting...[A][X]

## SHPCAlenaCristo
[ML][LoadAlena][MR][LoadCristo]
Princess, what I did to you[N]
during that fight was[AN]
completely unforgiveable.[N]
Letting you fall victim[AN]
to my own Defeat... I'm[N]
not worthy of your presence.[AN]
[ML]
Cristo, what are you talking[N]
about? Defeat goes wrong[AN]
fairly often. But when it[N]
hits, it'll kill anyone![AN]
Accidents happen. Don't[N]
beat yourself up about it.[AN]
Let's beat up everyone in[N]
Sylx Tower instead![A]
[MR]
Oh, Princess... So strong,[N]
yet so kind. Oh, how I love[AN]
her... Did I say that out[N]
loud? What I meant to say--[AN]
[ML]
You... love me? Really?[N]
I... never noticed...[AN]
What if I said that I[N]
love you too, Cristo?[A][X]

So, you have made it to the bottom[N]

Congratulations, brave Light[N]

I gave my life to unseal Ultima[N]
many years ago.[AN]
[Right]

We've found many powerful weapons[N]
in this dungeon.[AN]
Chaos won't stand a chance with[N]

Do not ignore Chaos's allies.[N]
I know the Emperor has risen.[AN]
[FR]
//HERO:
The Dragonlord hast returned...[N]
Preparing to split thy world...[AN]
[ML]
//MINH:
The amount of evil contained[N]
within Sylx Tower is astounding.[AN]
I would like to talk to all of[N]
you, but I lack the time.[AN]
I will return to the afterlife[N]
soon. Unfortunately, you are[AN]
going to have to walk all the[N]
way back to the entrance.[AN]
//FIGHTER:
[Right]
That is the most evil part of[N]
all. Why can't we cast Exit?[AN]
//MINH:
[ML]
Much magic has been sealed here[N]
for a variety of reasons.[AN]
Maria's Ultima cast may have[N]
summoned me, but Exit fails.[AN]
However, a fellow Light Warrior[N]
may lend you his aid here.[AN]
[FL][LoadOnionKid]
Howdy. They call me Onion Kid.[N]
I and my three fellow kids[AN]
ran through the Labyrinth[N]
of the Ancients, Forbidden[AN]
Land Eureka, Sylx Tower, and[N]
the Dark World all without[AN]
breaking a sweat or using Exit.[N]
We only rested outside Sylx.[AN]
There's six times more heroes,[N]
so why are you struggling?[AN]
[FR]
Such arrogance... Thy enemy[N]
hails from the world over![AN]
There are likely six times[N]
more foes as well, Onion Kid![A]
[FL]
Oh, Dragon Warrior guy. Look,[N]
money talks in the world.[AN]
I need to buy some more[N]
shurikens in the shop behind[AN]
that secret passage there.[N]
If you can stump up a total[AN]
of 65,500 gil, I'll open[N]
a shortcut to Sylx Tower.[AN]
Exchange any dollars, Makka,[N]
Mesetas, gold, or GP first![AN]

thing! ...Oh, fine.[AN][X]

//LUCIFER:
I'm not one inclined to heed orders.[N]
And last I checked, your Pandemonium[AN]
stunt took quite a fair bit out of[N]
the Abyss: that's my realm![AN]
Do you care for the rule of chaos[N]
at all? Or do you support law?[AN]
//EMPEROR:
Yes, the law! The only law is my[N]

ruled hell. Why not... heaven?[AN]
//LUCIFER:
I have no evidence... but I think[N]
you've your lot with the angels![A]

Enough! When we crush those threats,[N]
we can ask Chaos about his thoughts[AN]
later. You two will guard the tower[N]
along with me. Necrosaro, report?[AN]

You won't be able to kill him.[N]
Now my five Demon Dragons are[AN]
very hungry, and it seems like[N]
their next meal is extra-large.[AN]
Five people per dragon... [N]

Akaneia. If Hardin is[N]

//HARDIN:
I am Prince Hardin of[N]

There you are! I was so worried[N]

It could be better. We're in[N]
a stalemate in Macedonia.[AN]
Princess Nina put me in charge[N]
in your absence, Marth.[AN]
But I fear I lack the tactical[N]
acumen required to defeat[AN]
Misheil and clear the way to[N]
Durhua and Mediuth.[AN]

If you're struggling now,[N]
how can you defeat Durhua?[AN]
I must ask you a question,[N]
Lord Hardin: Is Chiki well?[AN]

Yes, that girl... Actually,[N]
she's inconsolable. She can't[AN]
say anything beyond the first[N]
syllable of your name.[AN]
Mostly "Mar-Mar", occasionally[N]
"Ban-Ban", and something about[AN]
promises and nightmares and[N]
degeneration? I don't know.[AN]
[FR]
Lord Hardin, I've actually[N]
been thinking of what plans[AN]
are being drawn up for the[N]
aftermath of the war.[AN]
[Left]
Actually, I've heard Bishop[N]
Boa discuss the succession.[AN]
Either you, Prince Marth, or[N]
I will have a marriage[AN]
arranged with Princess Nina.[N]
I would be very happy with[AN]
such an arrangement - I can[N]
only hope Nina is too.[AN]
[Right]
(Hardin doesn't know yet...[N]
I might have to break his[AN]
heart now, but for the sake[N]
of averting the War of Heroes...)[AN]
Hardin, there's something[N]
you need to know about Nina.[AN]
She loves General Camus. Not[N]
you, and not me. Don't ask[AN]
how I know, but a marriage[N]
between you and her will[AN]
result in a horrible disaster[N]
that will ruin Akaneia.[AN]

Perhaps it would be best if[N]
she could marry Camus instead?[AN]
[Left]
[Beat][.....] [Beat][.....] [Beat][.....] [Beat][.....] [Beat][.....] [N]
Of course. I understand now.[AN]
You and Camus were colluding.[N]
Working to undermine me.[AN]
Take all the credit. Camus[N]
rides off with Nina into the[AN]
sunset. You and Sheeda - don't[N]
think I don't notice you,[AN]
you act like you're married -[N]
want to carve the world up...[AN]
Who's to say that's not just[N]
another level of the scheme?[AN]
Maybe you want Nina's hand,[N]
Marth! Or were you leading[AN]
Sheeda along, and you truly[N]
love one of the other women[AN]
in this new army you built?[N]
You only care about yourself.[AN]
[Right]
If this is how you're reacting[N]
now, how must you have felt[AN]
when the truth came out the[N]
first time around?[AN]
[Left]
Enough! Starlight is ready, and[N]
I'll pierce Mediuth's scales[AN]
with the Gradius! I've had[N]
enough of this: take me home![A]
[FR]
Marth, I think you made a big[N]
mistake being so forthright[AN]
about what to Hardin was the[N]
future. He didn't take it well.[AN]
[Right]
I can only hope he recovers[N]
and defeats Garnef -[AN]
we need to go after Mediuth.[N]
Sheeda, what's wrong?[AN]
[FR]
//another moment where conditionals would be nice: canon-friendly happy finisher
//if you stick to it, Sheeda catching on if Marth cheats on her
//This convo's a harsh one, let's default to cheating
Oh, nothing. Just thinking[N]
about something Hardin[AN]
said. You've been looking[N]
at me less recently, Marth.[AN]
Is Talis not enough? Do you[N]
want Santeem? Or are you[AN]
aiming higher: is all Algol[N]
your ultimate ambition?[A]
[Right]
Of course not. I would never.[N]
You know I wouldn't.[AN]
[FL]
Perhaps this is Artemis's[N]
Curse working its magic...[A][X]

## SHPCSoloSaysHello
[FL][LoadCristo][Left][LoadAlena][Right][LoadSolo][FR][LoadTaloon]
[Right]
Taloon! Cristo! Alena! It is[N]
good to see you again.[AN]
We were all scattered after[N]
Balzack utterly destroyed[AN]
us. I didn't think you three[N]
would be so far away...[AN]
[FR]
I've been feeling a bit lost[N]
recently: I'm glad to see[AN]
you here. Of course, I've made[N]
a fair sum of gold too![AN]
[Left]
Necrosaro's still out there.[N]
The Secret of Evolution is[AN]
still out there... Just how[N]
strong could he get?[AN]
Well, however strong he gets,[N]
I'll get stronger![AN]
[FL]
Have you had any luck finding[N]
the Mini Medals? I've been[AN]
doing my part in defeating[N]
the many, many foes here.[AN]
When I don't end up defeating[N]
a friend by mistake...[AN]
[Right]
None of you have changed in[N]
terms of personality, anyway.[AN]
Alena, you look terrible,[N]
and what is that stench?[AN]
[Left]
It's a long story involving[N]
a massive brawl over crystals.[AN]
[Right]
I see. Anyway, I didn't find[N]
any Mini Medals, and I hope[AN]
Taloon bought you all some[N]
good equipment. Necrosaro[AN]
destroyed my hometown. I[N]
can't just forgive him.[AN]
[FR]
I'd bet my shop in Endor that[N]
all of these villains are[AN]
evolving. How can we stand[N]
up to them? Can we?[AN]
[FL]
Time isn't on our side: if[N]
Necrosaro and friends end[AN]
up evolving beyond our[N]
capabilities...[AN]
Let's not worry about that.[N]
Brey must be worried sick[AN]
with our absence: let's save[N]
the world and fix that![AN]
[Right]
Well said. Remember, do what[N]
you think is right, and[AN]
we cannot fail in any way![N]
We will triumph![A][X]

## SHPCWhatNext
[FL][LoadMinh][Left][LoadBritish][Right][LoadFirion][FR][LoadMaria]
[Left]
Congratulations on a job well[N]
done. Sylx Tower shall trouble[AN]
thee no more. But the threat[N]
persists from further beyond.[AN]
Yet, perhaps there is a peaceful[N]
solution to thine issues?[AN]
[Right]
The Emperor is dead, for now.[N]
Yet it feels like there is[AN]
a great deal of unfinished work.[N]
Yes, I'm exhausted, but is[AN]
calling a truce the right thing[N]
to do? I'm not so sure.[AN]
[FR]
Maybe some of them have their[N]
reasons for doing what they[AN]
did. We shouldn't surrender.[N]
But perhaps we should listen.[AN]
[FL]
If you believe that is the[N]
correct course of action,[AN]
then very well. I must return[N]
to the heavens soon.[AN]
Be careful. No matter what,[N]
you must succeed.[AN][Clear]
[FL][LoadGuy]
So, when are we going to be[N]
thrown somewhere else?[AN]
[Right]
We have to have missed[N]
something, somewhere.[AN]
[Left]
My advice to thee is to[N]
be sure to search all[AN]
objects. My knowledge may[N]
be great, but it is not[AN]
absolute. Thou shalt not[N]
give up now...[AN]
When setting out on a quest,[N]
I say "Do not return[AN]
until thou art done!"[N]
Chaos, Necrosaro, Mediuth...[AN][X]

## SHPCThroughTheMirror
[Left][LoadArle][Right][LoadNakajima][FR][LoadYumiko]
[Left]
I was promised tactics and[N]
puzzles, and I was given[AN]
walking and more walking.[N]
Surely I can spice things[AN]
up a bit somehow. Nakajima,[N]
humour me for a moment.[AN]
[Right]
Crawling through dungeons[N]
is a puzzle in of itself.[AN]
Though you don't have to[N]
deal with hordes of demons.[AN]
[Left]
Well there are individuals that[N]
could be considered demons.[AN]
Satan doesn't really require[N]
any further explaination![AN]
[FR]
Satan? You've fought him?[N]
We've just defeated Lucifer.[AN]
I've heard rumours that he's[N]
behind the Suzuki Company's[AN]
success in Tokyo recently.[N]
I have no proof, but the[AN]
Mesian Church had grown very[N]
powerful recently...[AN]
[Left]
Suzuki Company? Mesian[N]
Church? Can't say I know[AN]
what you're talking about.[N]
This mirror looks quite[AN]
interesting, though. I can[N]
see my reflection, anyway![AN]
[Right]
Arle, are you sure touching[N]
this mirror is a good idea?[AN]
It could send you anywhere.[N]
And I do mean anywhere![AN]
[Left]
Everyone's wondering where[N]
Chaos went. I think this[AN]
mirror is the key. If I'm[N]
trapped... I can't control[AN]
that. Mirror, mirror, on the[N]
wall, work your magic![AN][Clear]
//You should really fire up Madou Monogatari if only so Arle can shout a spell
//A bit too late for making sure she's in character!
[FR]
She's gone... Nakajima, we[N]
need to follow Arle through[AN]
this mirror. You go after[N]
her, I'll let Fighter know.[AN]
[Right]
Of course, Yumiko. I hope we[N]
have everything work out...[A][X]

## SHPCNextStopDarkWorld
[FL][LoadAlis][Left][LoadFighter][Right][LoadWhiteMage]
[FL]
You wouldn't believe how long[N]
it took for me to figure out[AN]
how to expose Lassic's castle.[N]
Actually, that gives me an[AN]
idea. This is the top of the[N]
tower - is there a secret?[AN]
[FR][LoadYumiko]
Fighter, there you are. Alis[N]
is right: there is a secret.[AN]
Arle vanished after touching[N]
a mirror. It must lead to[AN]
some hidden room. Nakajima[N]
followed her in: we can't[AN]
just leave them. The mirror[N]
is this way: we can't wait.[AN]
[Right]
I'm tired, I can barely muster[N]
up the energy to cast Cure,[AN]
but I also know leaving Chaos[N]
alone and evolving into a[AN]
stronger form could result[N]
in all of us dying later on.[AN]
Fighter, what do you think?[N]
Do we rest, or do we go on?[AN]
[Left]
We go on. We haven't come this[N]
far just to turn back.[AN]
I know it would be better to[N]
plan, but I'm not a planner.[AN]
I am a fighter. And where[N]
one of us goes, all of us go.[AN]
[Right]
I hate to say this, but... just[N]
in case... should someone[AN]
stay here, to live to fight[N]
another day?[AN]
[FL]
It can't hurt to be too safe.[N]
Someone will volunteer, I'm[AN]
sure. Not me, though: I'm not[N]
leaving this mission undone.[AN]
[Right]
And if you think you can go[N]
in without me, forget it.[AN]
Fighter, we're doing this[N]
together. We will break all[AN]
of these time loops. We will[N]
defeat Chaos. We will win![A]
[Left]
Thanks, White Mage. You too,[N]
Alis. Everyone! We have one[AN]
final job to do. Through this[N]
mirror is a secret room.[AN]
I'm sure Chaos is hiding there![N]
Yumiko, lead the way.[AN]
[FR]
Where this leads, I do not[N]
know. Nakajima, hold on...[A][X]

## SHPCTheFirstDeal
[MR][LoadArle]
Where am I? This place is so[N]
dark. Who's there?[AN]
[ML][LoadDragonlord]
Ha ha ha... So, Zande was[N]
defeated after all.[AN]
Dost thou know me? I am[N]
the Dragonlord![AN]
Thou art naught like that[N]
contemptable Erdrick.[AN]
Perhaps you may be more[N]
intelligent, young lady?[AN]
[MR]
My name's Arle. Well, Dragonlord?[N]
What do you want?[AN]
Why shouldn't I attack you right[N]
now? Give me a good reason.[AN]
[ML]
Haste makes waste. I give thee[N]
now a chance to share this world[AN]
and to rule half of it if thou[N]
will now stand beside me. What[AN]
sayest thou? Will the great[N]
...wizard stand with me?[AN]
[MR]
Really, now? Why in the world[N]
should I take you at your word?[AN]
No, I don't need to rule half[N]
of the world, thank you.[AN]
[ML]
Thou art a fool! My strength[N]
hast grown much. FIREVOLT![AN][X]
//"Hurtmost" probably if DQ1 had three tiers, but it doesn't,
//so use the later NES "Firevolt" here

## SHPCReinforcementsArrive
[ML][LoadDragonlord][Right][LoadArle][FR][LoadNakajima]
Another demon... Arle, are[N]
you alright?[AN]
[Right]
That flame hurt, but I'll live.[N]
Are the others coming?[AN]
[ML]
Reinforcements... This changes[N]
things! Well then. You claim[AN]
to be able to summon demons.[N]
Can you prove it?[AN]
[FR]
I'd happily negotiate. However,[N]
I would prefer to wait a minute[AN]
to enter into a stronger position.[N]
Until then, let's battle.[A][X]

## SHPCDragonlordDealsWithEveryone
[ML][LoadDragonlord][MR][LoadFighter]
[ML]
When I battled Erdrick's heir,[N]
we did battle one versus one.[AN]
I count almost thirty souls[N]
standing in front of me.[AN]
I see Erdrick himself. I see[N]
the heroes of Necrosaro's[AN]
war against humanity. I see[N]
thy fantastic counterparts.[AN]
But I largely bear you no ill[N]
will. Fine. Let us engage in[AN]
collective bargaining. I shall[N]
negotiate for Chaos's side.[AN]
[MR]
Grr... I'm not very good at[N]
this talking business.[AN]
The Hero has dealt with him[N]
before. You do it![AN][Clear]
[LoadHero]
So, we dost meet again.[N]
Princess Gwaelin hast[AN]
vanished. Where is she?[N]
I'll discuss nothing if[AN]
thou does not prove her[N]
continued safety.[AN]
[ML]
Of course, of course. Ha ha ha...[N]
Very well. I shall retrieve her.[A][X]

## SHPCWeSmellARat
[FL][LoadGuy][Left][LoadFirion][MR][LoadMaria]
This reminds me of the[N]
fake Princess Hilda trick[AN]
the Emperor pulled on us.[N]
I don't trust the Dragonlord.[AN]
[ML]
Neither do I, but we're not[N]
party to these talks...[AN]
We did agree to hear him[N]
out though. Maybe we're[AN]
wrong about him. We should[N]
stay on our guards.[AN]
[FL]
Look, he's coming back.[N]
I see a woman too.[AN][X]

## SHPCPullingAnAlvis
[FL][LoadDragonlord][Left][LoadGwaelin][Right][LoadHero]
[FL]
Gwaelin, I did not expect to[N]
see thy former lover here,[AN]
but his presence cannot be[N]
denied. He should know the[AN]
truth. Who better to tell[N]
him than you?[AN]
[Left]
Thou may consider thyself a[N]
hero, but I know better.[AN]
The Dragonlord is Alefgard's[N]
true hero. The Ball of Light[AN]
comes from the world above.[N]
What business does it have[AN]
down here in Alefgard? The[N]
natural order must return.[AN]
[Right]
...Gwaelin? What has he[N]
done to you?[AN]
[Left]
Nothing. We simply had a long[N]
conversation about the[AN]
fate of Alefgard. Erdrick[N]
himself came from above.[AN]
I have no doubt thou hast[N]
had many affairs in my[AN]
absence and received a sum[N]
of puff-puffs. I say thou[AN]
should head Outside, Return[N]
some place far away, and[AN]
wake up Healed tomorrow.[N]
But I shall see thee no more.[AN]
[Right]
Is... she telling me... to leave[N]
the room posthaste? Gwaelin[AN]
cannot be serving the Dragonlord.[N]
That is incomprehensible...[AN]
[FL]
You heard my lady. Someone[N]
else, come forward to talk.[AN][X]

//various offers, write later

## SHPCFinalBreakdown
[Left][LoadDragonlord][Right][LoadBritish]
[Left]
Lord British, thy negotiations[N]
have bought us much time.[AN]
Negotiations have broken down.[N]
Thy truce is over! This ends[AN]
now! Thou art all trapped in[N]
thy past! Behold, thy future![A][X]

## SHPCTheCloudArrives
[Left][LoadDarkCloud][Right][LoadFighter]
[Left]
I, the Dark Cloud, have come[N]
to return all to the Void...[AN]
To turn both Light and Dark[N]
into nothingness...[AN]
And first, I will erase you[N]
with the Secret of Evolution,[AN]
a power now being realised![N]
You will all die here!![A][X]

## SHPCPostBarhara
And so, an era had come to pass.[AN]
Chaos's plans, stemming from the[N]
Temple of Fiends, led the Light[N]
Warriors into a disasterous fate.[AN]
A great many tales, sorrowful or[N]
otherwise, were lost to the world.[A][2NL]

Many people from many countries[N]

presumed dead. Their names are[N]
