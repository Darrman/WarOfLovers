## SHPCPrelude
# The premise is grand RPG crossover, FE4-style. 
# NARRATOR:
Welcome. The tale you are about to witness[N]
is a tale of grand ambition, entailing many[AN]
different countries. To introduce them all[N]
now would take far too long. This is a story[AN]
of heroes, of grand schemes, of success and[N]
failure. A saga spanning generations.[AN]
Well, good listener? I don't know your name.[N]
Please, could you tell me?[A]

## SHPCPostNameEntry
# NARRATOR:
So your name is [Tact]? I see. Your role in[N]
the story is to listen to me as it plays out.[AN]
Yes, I know traditionally the hero is named[N]
by the player. But there are so many heroes.[AN]
Light Warrior [Tact]! [Tact], descendant of[N]
Erdrick! Actually, Erdrick's birth name[AN]
is [Tact] as well! So you do not get to name[N]
any of the characters in this story.[AN]
Now without further ado... this is the[N]
Final Fantasy.[A][X]

## SHPCFF1Opening
The world is veiled in darkness.[N]
The wind stops, the sea is wild,[AN]
and the earth begins to rot.[N]
The people wait, their only hope,[AN]
a prophecy...[AN]
"When the world is in darkness[N]
Four Warriors will come..."[AN]
After a long journey, four young[N]
warriors arrive, each holding an ORB.[AN][X]

## SHPCInConeria
# FIGHTER:
So this Garland guy has kidnapped[N]
Princess Sara for reasons unknown.[AN]
# BLACK MAGE:
So our job is to[N]
light him up?[A]
# WHITE MAGE:
You light him up, I stop the rest[N]
of you from taking a dirt nap.[AN]
# THIEF:
I'll make sure I don't get into any[N]
unforseen trouble out here.[A]
# FIGHTER:
Before we do anything else, we need[N]
to go shopping. We have 400 gold.[AN]
Chain Armour for myself, Cure for[N]
White Mage, Fire for Black Mage.[AN]
I suppose Thief can take this[N]
Wooden Armour. Best weapons for[AN]
everyone. Alright, that should be[N]
about everything.[AN]
# BLACK MAGE:
These crystals won't get any[N]
brighter here in Coneria.[AN]
Let's go to the Temple of Fiends.[A][X]

## SHPCGarlandFight
# FIGHTER:
We've gotten everything we can.[N]
Garland has to be through here...[A]
# WHITE MAGE:
I've healed you as much as we can.[N]
Do you think we're ready?[A]
# FIGHTER:
Of course, White Mage.[N]
Let's go.[A]
# GARLAND:
No one touches my Princess!![N]
LIGHT WARRIORS??[AN]
You impertient fools. I, Garland,[N]
will knock you all down!![A][X]

## SHPCAfterGarland
# GARLAND:
Did you think you had won?[N]
You may all be still standing,[AN]
but you won't be bringing Sara[N]
home to Coneria this time![AN]
# FIGHTER:
What do you mean "this time"?[N]
I don't remember dying.[AN]
# GARLAND:
Is this not exactly how you started[N]
your quest when you defeated me?[AN]
I remember how you struck me down[N]
in the past. Light Warriors,[AN]
I hereby banish you from this plane![N]
You shall interfere no more![AN]
# BLACK MAGE:
I have an idea of what's going on...[N]
But we need to get out of here![AN]
# WHITE MAGE:
If I knew Exit this wouldn't be[N]
a problem... Run![AN]
# FIGHTER:
Looks like Thief already legged it.[N]
Hey, where'd the ORBs go?[AN][X]

## SHPCInAlefgard
# FIGHTER:
This is not how things were meant[N]
to go. Where in the world am I?[AN]
# post-DW1, so he can run off with Gwaelin
# if I feel like requantising her
# HERO:
You appear to be lost, traveller.[N]
What is thy name?[AN]
# FIGHTER:
I don't really have one. I'm just[N]
Fighter, because I'm a fighter.[A]
# HERO:
Hm, thou art quite like a soldier,[N]
but that matters not.[AN]
I am usually addressed as simply the[N]
Hero, descendant of Erdrick.[AN]
# FIGHTER:
Erdrick? The man buried in Elfland?[N]
You're descended from him?[AN]
# HERO:
Pray tell, where is this Elfland?[N]
There is no such place on Alefgard.[AN]
# FIGHTER:
So I'm on Alefgard, completely lost,[N]
my party is missing...[AN]
# HERO:
Myself and Princess Gwaelin are on a[N]
quest to found a new kingdom.[AN]
You are free to accompany us...[A][X]

## SHPCFastForwardToCh5
## NARRATOR:
Well, I've been reading from chapter 1 of[N]
12, but I think the best part is chapter[AN]
6. [Tact], I hope you have no objections[N]
to me fast-forwarding through the story.[AN]
No? Excellent. Let me just recite the[N]
important plot points...[A][X]

## SHPCTimeTravelToDQ3
# ERDRICK:
All that seperates us from Baramos is[N]
the cave through the Necrogond...[AN]
Soldier, Priest, Wizard! Let's go![N]
Wait, where's Wizard? Who are you?[AN]
# HERO:
I am the descendant of Erdrick...[A]
# ERDRICK:
Who? ...Oh. Oh, I remember now.[N]
I knew this quest was familiar.[AN]
The people of Alefgard gave that[N]
title to me.[AN]
Wait, if you're my descendant...[N]
So, you're from the future?[AN]
I have a lot of questions...[N]
Let's start with this one:[AN]
Is Alefgard well?[A][X]

## SHPCLostInDuncansFactory
# NINTEN:
Okay, somebody somewhere is making[N]
us relive our adventure.[AN]
Duncan's Factory is still as confusing[N]
as ever to navigate.[AN]
# LLOYD:
Another group is approaching us![N]
I've got the bottle rockets![AN]
# FIGHTER:
Hey, don't shoot us! We're lost too![N]
# LLOYD:
You are? Well the railway's closed[N]
because there's a rock on the tracks.[AN]
So I launched a rocket to clear the[N]
way last time I was here.[AN]
# NINTEN:
You all look so old-fashioned. What's[N]
with the suits of armour?[AN]
# FIGHTER:
How else am I meant to protect[N]
myself from enemies?[AN]
# NINTEN:
Well, let's launch that rocket,[N]
find Ana, and solve this mystery.[A][X]

## SHPCRevisitingAkaneia
# MARTH:
I remember this battle. Trying to[N]
convince Camus to defect is futile.[AN]
The only way would be to have saved[N]
the twins earlier and convince Grunia[AN]
as a whole to switch sides. But I[N]
didn't know they were in Khadein![AN]
# FIGHTER:
Honestly, I was never in any ambigious[N]
situations back at home.[AN]
Never any situations where I'd rather[N]
not have to fight my opponent.[AN]
# SHEEDA:
It's not that simple. Camus and Nina were[N]
in love, so she tried to recruit him.[AN]
We then "kill" him, except he lived by[N]
washing up on the shores of Valencia.[AN]
# FIGHTER:
What are you all worrying about then?[N]
Nobody dies. Everything worked out.[AN]
# MARTH:
Nina thought he was dead, and she had to[N]
get in an arranged marriage with Hardin.[AN]
He loved her, but she did not love him,[N]
which ultimately corrupted him.[AN]
So if we could recruit Camus now, the[AN]
War of Heroes could be averted![A][X]

## SHPCLostInAMaze
# NAKAJIMA:
It's so hot down here. I just need to[N]
find Izanami, make it to Infini,[AN]
and send Lucifer right back to hell.[N]
Hm, they don't look like any demons[AN]
I've ever seen before. Okay, what do[N]
you want?[AN]
# FIGHTER:
I want to know where I am, who you are,[N]
what's going on, and it's too hot![A]
# YUMIKO:
This is the Rotting Sea of Flames.[N]
I'm Yumiko, he's Nakajima, and[AN]
we're basically repeating our quest.[AN]
# FIGHTER:
I've been through a lot of places,[N]
and the same few themes come up.[AN]
Somebody has to be co-operating[N]
somewhere, bringing us together...[AN]
# NAKAJIMA:
It seems every time I write a program,[N]
something goes horribly wrong.[AN]
I wanted to make a game out of this maze.[N]
But finishing Devil Busters can wait.[A][X]

## SHPCNoMoreAbridging
# NARRATOR:
And so, the Fighter and his army had[N]
travelled across the genre, meeting[AN]
many people from many walks of life.[N]
Finally, he aimed to return home.[AN]
However, the army missed Coneria and[N]
landed in the future.[AN]
[Tact], we're at the best part now.[N]
Trust me. Wake up, you have to see it.[AN]
This is the hardest final dungeon.[N]
At least, that I know of.[A][X]

## SHPCOpeningTowerPlotting
# ZANDE:
Make yourselves at home, everyone.[N]
The process is almost complete.[AN]
Some of our number have succumbed[N]
to those so-called heroes...[AN]
But we'll finally have our way with[N]
all of existance![A]
# ZOMA:
Yes... Darkness will cover all![N]
No more will that bloodline of[AN]
heroic types try to threaten my[N]
dominion over Alefgard![A]
# DRAGONLORD:
Zoma, Erdrick may have struck you[N]
down before, but rest assured I[AN]
have a plan that'll render him and[N]
his descendant harmless.[AN]
In fact, they may no longer be our[N]
enemies at all if this goes right![AN]
# CHAOS (maybe GARLAND if lazy):
When has he ever said yes to your[N]
offer of half the world?[AN]
This is why trapping everyone in[N]
time loops is the better idea.[AN]
# EMPEROR:
How convoluted. I've bent hell to[N]
my whim before. I can do it again.[AN]
And all of those ants will be sent[N]
there sooner or later.[AN]
# DRAGONLORD:
It has absolutely worked before![N]
But it never gets written on the[AN]
Imperial Scrolls of Honour, and[N]
then he's changed his mind![AN]
# MEDIUTH:
Silence! The fact of the matter is[N]
that those stupid humans betrayed[AN]
the dragons. They shall pay for their[N]
crimes with mistreatment in kind.[AN]
# NECROSARO:
Agreed. Their greed, their savagery...[N]
it knows no bounds! They killed[AN]
my Rosa. The Secret of Evolution will[N]
soon be complete. And then, humanity[AN]
will fall! It's only justice for what[N]
they've done to monsters![A][X]
# EMPEROR:
Well, let's just focus on exterminating[N]
our current enemies. They're at the[AN]
bottom of the Sylx Tower, and we're[N]
at the top. Can they get in?[AN]
# ZANDE:
Considering the amount of teleportation[N]
they've been doing, Dorga and Unne[AN]
have almost certainly been visited.[N]
They can get in.[AN]
# LASSIC:
What?! This is why you have a castle[N]
floating in the sky. Also, make it[AN]
invisible so you can't fly any space[N]
ships into it.[AN]
# ZOMA:
I'll never understand your obsession[N]
with "space ships". Such technology[AN]
is utterly baffling to me. Swords and[N]
sorcery is what I understand best![AN]
# GIEGUE:
No matter how primitive the humans[N]
may be, they must not be taken lightly.[AN]
They often find their way where they[N]
don't belong... such as in song...[A]
# CHAOS:
Well, I think that's about everything.[N]
Prepare for that pesky Fighter![A][X]

## SHPCOpeningEntranceCrystalBrawl
# FIGHTER:
If I spent one more minute in that[N]
maze, I would have lost it.[AN]
And now the Sylx Tower is right here.[N]
Every evil plotter is lurking there![A]
# HERO:
Thy crystals are as tacky as usual.[N]
Art thou prepared to ascend?[AN]
# BLACK MAGE:
What are you calling tacky?![N]
I quite like these crystals.[AN]
It beats the typical dreary[N]
dungeon, that's for sure.[AN]
# ERDRICK:
Not everything is about crystals![N]
Now you're defending the enemy's[AN]
castle because you think it looks[N]
nice. I swear...[AN]
# FIRION:
Nobody ever said anything about[N]
defending the enemy! It looks nice[AN]
on the outside, but I'm sure it's[N]
rotten on the inside.[AN]
# TALOON:
What is going on here?[N]
We don't need to fight![AN]
# ERDRICK:
Black Mage over there is annoyed[N]
my descendant criticised crystals.[AN]
# BLACK MAGE:
You know the value of things,[N]
right? How much is this ORB[AN]
worth? It's priceless. Nature[N]
will fall apart otherwise.[AN]
# TALOON:
Considering that tower is made entirely[N]
of crystals, the market would be[AN]
significantly depressed. They'd be nearly[N]
nearly worthless. A hundred gold each?[AN]
# FIGHTER:
You're calling the Crystals worthless?![N]
Idiots! Chaos can wait - get over here,[AN]
Erdrick! I'm sending you right back to[N]
Elfland![AN]
# ERDRICK:
Oh, you think you know it all![N]
Well I'll show you a little[AN]
trick far beyond you! Lightning![A]
# BLACK MAGE:
Oh, that's a nice Lit 3. How do you[N]
like a taste of this? NUKE![AN]
# HERO:
Healmore! We are outnumbered![N]
Help is urgently required![AN]
# SOLDIER:
Alright, I've been itching to test[N]
these weapons out. Hah![AN]
# FIRION:
Hey, leave me out of this. Maria![N]
Guy! I need some help here![AN]
# MARIA:
Alright, I'll hit them from afar.[AN]
# GUY:
Hm... Oh, alright.[A]
# Faces clear as units move around a bunch.
Ice 3![A]
Zap![A]
Fast![A]
Healall![A]
Ruse![A]
Ironise![A]
# A bit further away...
# TALOON:
Phew! I got away. How did I start[N]
that fight? It needs to be stopped![A]
# ALENA:
Did somebody say "fight"? Where?[N]
I'm a bit out of practice.[AN]
# CRISTO:
Please, don't tell her-[A]
# TALOON:
It's that way--[A]
# ALENA:
Thanks! I'll be on my[N]
way then. Bye![A]
# CRISTO:
Princess! Wait! We're at camp![N]
They're probably training![A]
# TALOON:
Sigh... I didn't even properly[N]
appraise those crystals![AN]
# Back in the fight...
# ALENA:
Okay, who do I hit first...[N]
I know! I'll hit you![AN]
# FIGHTER:
Ouch! How did you hit me so[N]
hard? Well take this![AN]
# CRISTO:
You... you hurt the princess![N]
Unforgiveable! Beat![A]
# FIGHTER:
Do you see Sara around here?[N]
No! How could I hurt her?[AN]
# HERO:
Where oh where is Gwaelin?[N]
I believe she was taken by thou![AN]
# GUY:
Nonsense! Hilda's safe![A]
# MARIA:
Hey, White Mage! We need your help![N]
# WHITE MAGE:
What are you fighting about?[N]
I'll save my magic to heal[AN]
all of you when you're done,[N]
and don't make me cast Life![A]
# MARIA:
It was worth a try. There's[N]
one last spell worth trying.[AN]
# ERDRICK:
Well you won't get to try![N]
Stopspell![A]
# FIRION:
Mute won't save you! Try stopping[N]
this attack![A]
# SOLDIER:
Don't even try it.[N]
Take this![A]
# BLACK MAGE:
Desperate times call for desperate[N]
measures. Rub them out![A]
# ALENA:
Instant-death spells? I won't give[N]
you time to learn from your mistake![A]
# MARIA:
Fighter, Guy, cover me. I'm going[N]
to cast Ultima.[AN]
# GUY:
Ultima... will it work?[A]
# FIRION:
Cure! We will win this fight![A]
# HERO:
Thou art a fool! Hurtmore![A]
# CRISTO:
I can win this fight[N]
right now! Defeat![AN]
# FIGHTER:
Don't even try it.[N]
It'll never work![N]
# ALENA:
You and me, let's go![N]
Who's the better fighter?[AN]
# MARIA:
It's almost ready. Just a few[N]
more seconds...[AN]
# CRISTO:
If at first you don't succeed,[N]
try, try again! Defeat![AN]
# ALENA:
Cristo, will you ever--[N]
Ack...[A]
# FIGHTER:
Who are you loyal to?[N]
Are you planning a coup?[A]
# BLACK MAGE:
Now that's what I call a[N]
miss! I now cast Sabre![AN]
# ERDRICK:
You're casting useless spells now?[N]
Could you be any more condecending?[AN]
You're lucky Wizard's not here, because[N]
Bikill does its actual job![AN]
# MARIA:
It's ready. Meet the strongest spell[N]
of them all: ULTIMA!![A][X]

## SHPCOpeningBackToSquareOne
# Away from the brawl...
# MARTH:
Did anyone else feel that?[A]
# SHEEDA:
Feel what?[A]
# MARTH:
Just a light breeze...[N]
Nothing particularly strong.[A]
# BANUTU:
No... it's more than that.[N]
Something ancient is at work.[AN]
Our powers combined, in addition[N]
to our desperate situation...[AN]
Whatever's going on, it's something[N]
unprecedented...[A]
# SHEEDA:
There's a shape forming there.[N]
Everyone, get back![A]
# BRITISH:
I am Lord British, King of Britannia.[N]
I usually summon others to me,[AN]
but this situation is so dire, the[N]
entire genre is under threat.[AN]
In the beginning, everything was[N]
but a prompt on a screen.[AN]
Then came Ultima and Wizardry...[N]
The ancestors of all.[AN]
# MARTH:
You mean... before the descendant[N]
of Erdrick? That far back?[AN]
# BRITISH:
Marth Lowell, you are the youngest one[N]
here! You have great potential,[AN]
but it matters not if you succumb[N]
to the evil plots surrounding all.[AN]
Now, tell the Dragon Warrior and[N]
Final Fantasy people to cease.[AN]
Such petty, unvirtuous infighting[N]
serves nobody.[AN]
Gather everybody together. Much[N]
needs to be explained.[A][X]

## SHPCOpeningNoOhmStaffHere
# MARIA:
I thought this would actually[N]
achieve something for once.[AN]
# FIRION:
So there's five of us, three[N]
of them, and we're exhausted.[AN]
# SHEEDA:
Everyone, stop fighting![N]
I don't know what you're[AN]
fighting about, but it[N]
won't achieve anything.[AN]
# CRISTO:
I managed to kill my princess[N]
with my own Defeat spell![AN]
And we've done no damage to[N]
the other side...[AN]
# ERDRICK:
What were we fighting over?[N]
I lost myself in the heat[AN]
of the moment. I'm sure it[N]
wasn't anything too big.[AN]
# WHITE MAGE:
Fighter, what did I tell you all[N]
about making me have to use Life?[AN]
# FIGHTER:
It wasn't my fault! Something[N]
about crystals, nothing big...[AN]
# WHITE MAGE:
Whatever, we can figure that out[N]
after we kill Chaos.[AN]
Life! ...No effect. Why does it[N]
have to fail now?[AN]
# CRISTO:
Let me try. I killed Alena, it's[N]
only right... Vivify![AN]
It failed, hardly surprising...[N]
Vivify! Attempt 3... Vivify![AN]
# WHITE MAGE:
Life 2! ...Okay, that should[N]
never be able to fail.[AN]
# GUY:
No Phoenix Downs here. Life won't[N]
work. Is death... permanent?[AN]
# SHEEDA:
I think something is stopping revival[N]
magic from working. Even though this[AN]
dungeon is associated with Fighter, it's[N]
following my rules. The only way to[AN]
revive the dead is to use a special[N]
staff that only works for princesses![AN]
# FIRION:
Sheeda, aren't you a princess?[A]
# SHEEDA:
I have no idea how to use magic.[N]
Surely there's another princess...[AN]
Anyway, we have a meeting to attend.[N]
Everyone needs to be present.[AN][X]

## SHPCOpeningBritishLecture
# BRITISH:
So, thou hast finally come. Even if[N]
many of you are injured or dead.[AN]
I shall introduce myself again.[N]
I am Lord British, King of Britannia.[AN]
This is a mission of grave import.[N]
Thou must defeat the evil atop the[AN]
Sylx Tower by any means necessary.[N]
But charging up there is folly.[AN]
# ODIN:
And what'll happen if we do just[N]
charge on up the tower?[AN]
# BRITISH:
Odin, from the Algol star system...[N]
Certain failure will occur if[AN]
thy party neglects Eureka.[N]
You did not lose the key?[AN]
# TALOON:
It's hiding in one of these bags,[N]
I'm sure. Ah, I have it![AN]
# BRITISH:
Thou should mind that key, Torneko[N]
Taloon, or defeat is sure.[AN]
Many powerful weapons lurk in[N]
the Forbidden Land, Eureka.[AN]
# ARLE:
Why do we need these weapons[N]
anyway? We should just out-smart[AN]
them instead. That would save[N]
us from this long detour![AN]
# BRITISH:
Arle Nadja, you may be fond of your[N]
puzzles, but wisdom alone will not[AN]
save you. Conventional weaponry will[N]
do little damage, as will most magic.[AN]
# ANA:
But what if it's psychic power?[N]
Can I get them with some PK Beam?[AN]
# BRITISH:
Ana, from freezing Snowman...[N]
If PK Beam Gamma is what you[AN]
speak of, it will fail every time.[N]
PK Freeze Gamma fails also.[AN]
# NAKAJIMA:
Is there any potential for talk?[N]
Can we negotiate at all?[AN]
# BRITISH:
Akemi Nakajima, talking would be a[N]
waste of time. Thy foes will take[AN]
no quarter whatsoever. Either good[N]
will prevail, or evil.[AN]
Fighting amongst yourselves is folly,[N]
and goes against all virtue.[AN]
# HERO:
I am sorry for my role in starting[N]
that arguement earlier.[AN]
# FIGHTER:
I'm sorry too. We need to work together.[N]
What else must we know...[AN]
What awaits us at the end of Eureka?[AN]
# BRITISH:
Descendant of Erdrick, Light Warrior...[A]
Once you acquire the ultimate weapons,[N]
return to the surface and climb[AN]
the tower. Beware of the many villains[N]
that line the way to the summit.[AN]
# SOLDIER:
Are you a non-combatant, or can you[N]
defend yourself in any way?[AN]
# BRITISH:
Companion of Erdrick, I prefer to avoid[N]
direct intervention. But this situation[AN]
is extraordinary. Rest assured, I am[N]
more than capabable of defending myself.[AN]
Now, one final matter of business. The[N]
corpse in this crowd...[AN][X]

## SHPCOpeningEvenOhmIsDubious
# WHITE MAGE:
I attempted to revive Alena several[N]
times, but even Life 2 failed.[AN]
This shouldn't be possible. Something[N]
is very wrong in this tower.[AN]
# BRITISH:
Allow me to attempt a miracle of[N]
resurrection. But if this fails,[AN]
there is no recourse. At worst,[N]
all that may remain are ashes...[AN]
# Ohm doesn't need a body, I could reduce Alena to ashes for a minute...
# Any rewrite is for another day
... It failed. Her body is still[N]
intact, but I highly advise against[AN]
any further attempts of revival.[AN]
# CRISTO:
Oh, what have I done? Princess...[N]
I... It's all my fault![AN]
# SHEEDA:
Princess, princess, princess...[N]
Am I the only living woman of[AN]
royal blood? Though I think Alena's[N]
just as bad with magic as me...[AN]
# ALIS:
When I finally avenged my brother,[N]
I found out my father used to[AN]
be the king. It came out of nowhere,[N]
but the system needed a ruler, so[AN]
I became the queen. But what's that[N]
got to do with anything?[AN]
# FIRION:
This is to do with revival magic.[N]
Apparently Akaneian mortality[AN]
is in effect despite not being[N]
there. I'm confused too.[AN]
# SHEEDA:
Good thing I borrowed this off of[N]
Ellis before this started.[AN]
Alis, this is the Ohm Staff. Do[N]
you have any magic abilities?[AN]
# ALIS:
I've some, but not a great deal.[N]
What rules does this staff have?[AN]
# MARTH:
Only royal women can use it, but[N]
it can revive the dead without[AN]
any restrictions whatsoever.[N]
Sometimes it has one use, other[AN]
times five. I'm not sure how[N]
many uses it has right now.[AN]
# ALIS:
Well, I never learned Life...[N]
Now's a good time to learn.[AN]
OHM![N]
# ALENA:
... ... Huh? What just happened?[N]
Right, somebody hit me with Defeat![AN]
Sniff... I don't remember smelling[N]
of rotten flesh...[AN]
# ALIS:
The staff broke. Is partial de-[N]
composition a standard side effect?[AN]
# MARTH:
No. I've never heard of such a side[N]
effect. Is something containing[AN]
the power of resurrection spells[N]
within Sylx Tower?[A]
# ALENA:
So I've gotten caught in a botched[N]
resurrection. Can I still fight?[AN]
# Something gets smashed; actually smacking someone may be a bridge too far
It seems that I can! Wait, I don't[N]
recognise you. Who are you?[AN]
# BRITISH:
Princess Alena of Santeem...[N]
Thou hast returned to life.[AN]
I am Lord British. Thou art[N]
truly alive, and thy wounds[AN]
shall heal given time. But if[N]
the strongest of all revival[AN]
magic is failing... We must[N]
not delay any further![AN]
# FIGHTER:
Our objective is clear: we[N]
charge into Eureka, gather[AN]
the strongest weapons, and[N]
take the fight to Chaos![A][X]

## MEDIUTH:
This... it wasn't perfect, but[N]
it's not far off at all.[A]
## NECROSARO:
Mediuth, what did you manage[N]
to pull off?[A]
## MEDIUTH:
Back in Durhua, it takes a massive[N]
amount of energy to revive the dead.[AN]
But everywhere else, it is trivial.[N]
So if I managed to harness enough[AN]
energy, I could impose my native rules[N]
on this tower.[AN]
## NECROSARO:
Very interesting. Does it only work[N]
on humans, or is it universal?[AN]
## MEDIUTH:
Universal. I'd love to see humanity[N]
get a taste of their own medicine,[AN]
but I can't exclusively seal off[N]
enemy resurrection spells.[AN]
## NECROSARO:
A shame... Perhaps there would be[N]
another way if we could revive.[AN]
Only divine intervention could[N]
bring Rosa back, and the gods[AN]
are not on our side. Evolution[N]
it is, then.[AN]
## CHAOS:
Hm... Mediuth, can you toggle your[N]
resurrection blocker? I could[AN]
try to revive the Four Fiends.[N]
Once they're back, turn it back on.[AN]
## MEDIUTH:
...It's permanent. It may be proximity[N]
based, in which case I could wait in[AN]
the Dark World, but otherwise, it's[N]
tied to my own life.[AN]
## CHAOS:
Unfortunate. Still, I saw the Light[N]
Warriors at the Dragon Warrior's[AN]
throat. Most of their resurrection[N]
spells doing absolutely nothing,[AN]
and their absolute strongest only[N]
partially reviving the dead?[AN]
## NECROSARO:
Oh, watching them fumble over[N]
themselves as their Vivifies[AN]
kept failing to revive that fool[N]
Alena... Oh, you were that close[AN]
to getting rid of one of those[N]
stupid chosen ones forever![AN]
Still, if she's a mindless zombie[N]
now, I thank you, Mediuth.[AN]
## MEDIUTH:
Apparently that Alis was a princess[N]
all along. I'll need a word with[AN]
Lassic about that one: I know Sheeda[N]
is and Alena was useless with magic.[AN]
If I knew Alis could use Ohm too,[N]
I'd have factored that in![AN]
## LASSIC:
What's this about Alis?! Bah, I[N]
knew I should have had her shot[AN]
too when I had the chance. Oh,[N]
good day, Mediuth, Necrosaro.[AN]
Don't you think we should move?[N]
I fear we may be found here![AN]
## NECROSARO:
You're still just a cowardly human.[N]
Powerful, but nothing more.[AN]
If you had told us about Alis,[N]
we may have prepared for this.[AN]
There's a queue for evolution,[N]
and remember I discovered the[AN]
Secret of Evolution! Lassic,[N]
you're going to have to wait.[AN]
## LASSIC:
Please, I'm just an old man.[N]
I need this power the most![AN]
Wait! Where are you going?[N]
Don't leave me behind![A][X]
