## SHPCPrelude
# The premise is grand RPG crossover, FE4-style. 
# NARRATOR:
Welcome. The tale you are about to witness[N]
is a tale of grand ambition, entailing many[AN]
different countries. To introduce them all[N]
now would take far too long. This is a story[AN]
of heroes, of grand schemes, of success and[N]
failure. A saga spanning generations.[AN]
Well, good listener? I don't know your name.[N]
Please, could you tell me?[A][X]

## SHPCPostNameEntry
# NARRATOR:
So your name is [Tact]? I see. Your role in[N]
the story is to listen to me as it plays out.[AN]
Yes, I know traditionally the hero is named[N]
by the player. But there are so many heroes.[AN]
Light Warrior [Tact]! [Tact], descendant of[N]
Erdrick! Actually, Erdrick's birth name[AN]
is [Tact] as well! So you do not get to name[N]
any of the characters in this story.[AN]
Now without further ado...[N]
[Red]The Final Fantasy[Red][A][X]

## SHPCFF1Opening
The world is veiled in darkness.[N]
The wind stops, the sea is wild,[AN]
and the earth begins to rot.[N]
The people wait, their only hope,[AN]
a prophecy...[AN]
"When the world is in darkness[N]
Four Warriors will come..."[AN]
After a long journey, four young[N]
warriors arrive, each holding an ORB.[AN][X]

Let's start with this one:[AN]
Is Alefgard well?[A]

It was when I departed with[N]

# GWAELIN:
So thou art Erdrick! It is[N]

is... who else do you[AN]
descend from? If you get[N]
what I'm trying to imply.[A]
[Right]
# HERO:
Who else? Ah, of course. I shall[N]
phrase it as such.[N]
Hero Erdrick, art thou in a[N]

Thou art their enemy as well,[N]

My name's Alena. I was fighting[N]
this monster, Balzack, who had[AN]
taken over Santeem. Mara and Nara[N]
especially wanted their revenge...[AN]

that so-called hero. And he's[N]

# HERO:
Zoma... Yes, I've heard of the[N]
name. You defeated him and[AN]
brought light to Alefgard for[N]
the first time.[AN]

I've never heard of any of these,[N]
but at the same time I feel[AN]

Well I foiled Giegue's invasion of[N]

# MARTH:
I remember this battle. Trying to[N]
convince Camus to defect is futile.[AN]
The only way would be to have saved[N]
the twins earlier and convince Grunia[AN]
as a whole to switch sides. But I[N]
didn't know they were in Khadein![AN]
[MR]
# FIGHTER:
Honestly, I was never in any ambigious[N]

# SHEEDA:
It's not that simple. Camus and Nina were[N]
in love, so she tried to recruit him.[AN]
We then "kill" him, except he lived by[N]
washing up on the shores of Valencia.[AN]
[MR]
# FIGHTER:
What are you all worrying about then?[N]
Nobody dies. Everything worked out.[AN]

# MARTH:
Nina thought he was dead, and she had to[N]
get in an arranged marriage with Hardin.[AN]
He loved her, but she did not love him,[N]
which ultimately corrupted him.[AN]
So if we could recruit Camus now, the[AN]
War of Heroes could be averted![A]

You think I didn't know?[N]
I'm well aware of his majesty[AN]
handing them over to Garnef.[N]
If you had brought them here[AN]
personally, that could change[N]
his majesty's mind. But I[AN]
will always fight for Grunia.[N]
If we signed a truce, Garnef[AN]
would have the prince and[N]

General Lawrence always opposed[N]

on humans, or is it universal?[AN]
# MEDIUTH:
Universal. I'd love to see humanity[N]
get a taste of their own medicine,[AN]
but I can't exclusively seal off[N]
enemy resurrection spells.[AN]
# NECROSARO:
A shame... Perhaps there would be[N]
another way if we could revive.[AN]
Only divine intervention could[N]
bring Rosa back, and the gods[AN]
are not on our side. Evolution[N]
it is, then.[AN]
# CHAOS:
Hm... Mediuth, can you toggle your[N]
resurrection blocker? I could[AN]
try to revive the Four Fiends.[N]
Once they're back, turn it back on.[AN]
# MEDIUTH:
...It's permanent. It may be proximity[N]
based, in which case I could wait in[AN]
the Dark World, but otherwise, it's[N]
tied to my own life.[AN]
# CHAOS:
Unfortunate. Still, I saw the Light[N]
Warriors at the Dragon Warrior's[AN]
throat. Most of their resurrection[N]
spells doing absolutely nothing,[AN]
and their absolute strongest only[N]
partially reviving the dead?[AN]
# NECROSARO:
Oh, watching them fumble over[N]
themselves as their Vivifies[AN]
kept failing to revive that fool[N]
Alena... Oh, you were that close[AN]
to getting rid of one of those[N]
stupid chosen ones forever![AN]
Still, if she's a mindless zombie[N]
now, I thank you, Mediuth.[AN]
# MEDIUTH:
Apparently that Alis was a princess[N]
all along. I'll need a word with[AN]
Lassic about that one: I know Sheeda[N]
is and Alena was useless with magic.[AN]
If I knew Alis could use Ohm too,[N]
I'd have factored that in![AN]
# LASSIC:
What's this about Alis?! Bah, I[N]
knew I should have had her shot[AN]
too when I had the chance. Oh,[N]
good day, Mediuth, Necrosaro.[AN]
Don't you think we should move?[N]
I fear we may be found here![AN]
# NECROSARO:
You're still just a cowardly human.[N]
Powerful, but nothing more.[AN]
If you had told us about Alis,[N]
we may have prepared for this.[AN]
There's a queue for evolution,[N]
and remember I discovered the[AN]
Secret of Evolution! Lassic,[N]
you're going to have to wait.[AN]
# LASSIC:
Please, I'm just an old man.[N]
I need this power the most![AN]
Wait! Where are you going?[N]
Don't leave me behind![A][X]
