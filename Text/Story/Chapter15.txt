## Ch15WorldMap
Claire's report had convinced Alm that peace[N]
was no longer a viable option.[AN]
War was inevitable, with the attack on Akaneia[N]
an open secret in Valencian conversation.[AN]
The wheels of the propaganda machine spun,[N]
yet in a twisted way, some of it was true.[AN]
There were infiltrators in the Valencian[N]
army: just Elyians instead of Akaneians.[AN]
Many of Alm's inner circle were suspicious[N]
of Celine's claims, but none dared call out[AN]
that she was not actually Celica.[AN]
So long as Alm played by her fiddle, Alear's[N]
plans for Valencia advanced without a hitch.[AN]
In the tattered remains of the Akaneian Empire,[N]
Kris's control of the east was largely solid.[AN]
But the Menedi River proved a stubborn line of[N]
defence, and Kain, the successor to Marich,[AN]
continued to hold off any further advance.[AN]
An uneasy coexistance had developed between[N]
the rebel factions in Grunia and Macedonia.[AN]
But the next turn of events would cast fear[N]
amongst every single one of these leaders.[AN]
In all of their calculation of Akaneians,[N]
not one gave Valencia a second thought.[AN]
Marth himself approached Sofia Castle: any[N]
hope of peace was rapidly evaporating.[AN]
Alm's next move would end up changing the[N]
course of the broader war on Elyos...[A][X]

[MR][LoadValbo][Left][LoadMarth][FL][LoadSheeda]
[MR]
Well, there it is: Sofia Castle.[N]
Finest building in Valencia.[AN]
Where Alm himself is... and[N]
he's not accepting visitors.[AN]
[FL]
We're not officially in a state[N]
of war yet. We could send[AN]
a messenger to open negotiations.[N]
But after that mess in Grove[AN]
Village, I'm not sure Alm would[N]
be willing to listen to us.[AN]
[Left]
I was always under the impression[N]
that Alm and Celica balanced each[AN]
other out. Yet Celica vanished,[N]
only for her to come back?[AN]
I wonder if Celica really came back.[N]
Do we enter the castle?[AN]
[MR]
Security is bound to be tight.[N]
And I'm sure you've been[AN]
recognised by now, Lord Marth.[N]
If we're to gain audience with[AN]
the emperor... I'm not sure how.[N]
A violent meeting doesn't count.[AN]
[Left]
We should set up camp nearby.[N]
Then we can sneak inside...[AN]
The problem with that is if[N]
an army patrol passes by.[AN]
[FL]
I'm going to make a fly by of[N]
the castle. I'll be back.[A][X]

## Ch15OpeningAlmDeclaresWar
[FL][LoadMycen][Left][LoadAlm]
//Mycen, Alm (no Celine, that'd give the game away!)
It's a lovely spring morning[N]
here in Sofia Castle.[AN]
But these peaceful days are[N]
nearing their end.[AN]
Pirate attacks are on the up.[N]
The old Doma Faithful are[AN]
beginning to stir.[N]
These are grave threats.[AN]
Yet a new threat has arrived[N]
from beyond the seas.[AN]
[FL]
Your majesty... you have made up[N]
your mind, haven't you?[AN]
[Left]
Indeed. About two weeks ago, a[N]
foreign army suddenly appeared.[AN]
They sabotaged the floodgate and[N]
have been making an advance on[AN]
Sofia Castle. You may be wondering[N]
who would launch such a shameless[AN]
attack on this island. Is it Mahha[N]
the pirate? No! Maneph the cultist?[AN]
Also no! It's Marth the emperor![N]
That's right! Emperor Marth of[AN]
Akaneia has launched an attack on[N]
us personally! Now, Akaneia is in[AN]
the throes of a civil war. So I[N]
have no idea which faction he has[AN]
ultimately sided with! For those[N]
following Emperor Kris's news,[AN]
his tale of Lythian retirement is[N]
completely and utterly false![AN]
Was it all a cover story? Perhaps.[N]
You cannot ignore Kain's faction.[AN]
Queen Anteze was captured by them.[N]
Was that kidnapping on Marth's[AN]
orders? Also very plausible! He may[N]
even have sided with a more minor[AN]
rebel faction. Nobody can be ruled[N]
out! Until the truth comes out,[AN]
consider all trade with the entire[N]
continent of Akaneia cut off.[AN]
All Akaneian shipping will be[N]
fired upon by Valencian fleets.[AN]
The time for peace is over. Let[N]
this speech serve for what it is:[AN]
a declaration of war! Valencia is now[N]
at war with the Akaneian Empire!![A][X]

## Ch15OpeningSheedasShock
[FR][LoadSheeda]
Oh no... An actual declaration of[N]
war! There's no other way we can[AN]
take that. How are we going to[N]
avoid this? We can't! I need to[AN]
tell Marth. This is going to[N]
end in tears, I just know it...[A]
[Left][LoadCleive][FL][LoadClaire]
//Claire, Cleive
[Left]
Wait just a minute... You're Sheeda,[N]
aren't you? Spying on us, hm?[AN]
Not even delegating the dirty work![N]
Guards, take her away![AN]
[FR]
Did you really think I came alone?[N]
Even if you can take me away,[AN]
one blow from this spear will[N]
make that your final act.[AN]
[FL]
Cleive, it's not worth it![N]
Marth probably has other spies.[AN]
What would he do if we killed[N]
his wife? He'd burn Sofia down![A]
[FR][ClearFace]
[Left]
Marth's already going to burn[N]
Sofia down! How much worse[AN]
could it get? We've passed[N]
the point of no return here.[AN]
[FL]
...Cleive, that woman is not Celica.[N]
She would have joined Alm for that.[AN]
I don't believe she was ill at all.[N]
I'll defend Sofia Castle, of course.[AN]
[Left]
You think the empress is a fraud?[N]
Claire, you may be my sister,[AN]
but that's high treason. I did[N]
mishear you, right?[AN]
[FL]
...Of course. That is Empress Anteze[N]
sitting next to Emperor Alm.[AN]
We argued for so long Sheeda just[N]
flew away! How boorish of us.[AN]
[Left]
Damn it! I'm sure she'll be back.[N]
No Akaneian is getting into Sofia[AN]
Castle. Mark my words![A][X]

## Ch15OpeningMarthLearns
[FR][LoadSheeda][Left][LoadMarth][FL][LoadChiki]
Sheeda, I've got a very bad feeling...[N]
Something horrible just happened.[AN]
[FR]
You're right. Marth, it's war. Alm[N]
just declared war on us.[AN]
He's not quite sure who's we're[N]
with, though.[AN]
[Left]
If worst comes to worst, we say[N]
we're loyal to Kris, and direct[AN]
Alm's wrath on the wrong faction.[N]
But this is utterly pointless![AN]
[FR]
Here, let me sum up Alm's speech.[N]
I'll make it quick...[AN][X]

## Ch15OpeningPrepareForBattle
[FR][LoadSheeda][Left][LoadMarth][FL][LoadChiki]
[Left]
And Celica never even showed her[N]
face once? Very suspicious.[AN]
[FR]
We have to talk to her at some[N]
point. Who's pulling the strings?[AN]
[FL]
Marth? Sheeda? There's people[N]
coming our way. They're not our[AN]
friends. Most of Valencia is[N]
full of enemies! I hate it here![A]
[Left]
The Knights of Valencia are lined[N]
up. Our countries are officially[AN]
at war. There's only one thing to[N]
do. I hate that it's come to this.[AN]
Everyone, attack Sofia Castle![N]
Our enemy is the Empire of Valencia![A][X]

## Ch15AfterPrepCleiveSpeech
[MR][LoadCleive]
//Cleive
The Akaneians are already at our[N]
doorstep! With your help, we can[AN]
end this war in a single battle![N]
The Knights of Valencia are a proud[AN]
order, and I am proud to be your[N]
commander. Knights, move out![A][X]

## Ch15EndingHowUseless
[MR][LoadMarth]
What a pointless battle. I never[N]
came here in order to attack[AN]
Sofia Castle. I just want to pass[N]
through and get back home.[AN]
Yet I'm about to overthrow the[N]
second-most powerful country in[AN]
the world, as far as I know.[N]
Alm never struck me as someone[AN]
unreasonable before all this.[N]
But was my impression wrong?[AN]
[ML][LoadSheeda]
Marth, we have everyone lined[N]
up outside the castle.[AN]
Are we going to charge in?[A]
[MR]
Yes, Sheeda.[N]
Yes we are.[A][X]

## Ch15EndingWarRoomSpat
[FL][LoadMycen][Left][LoadAlm][Right][LoadCeline][FR][LoadGrey]
//Mycen, Alm, Celine, Grey
[Left]
Was I wrong? Cleive is dead. I[N]
don't know where Claire is.[AN]
Marth is at the front gate.[N]
Did I just destroy Valencia?[AN]
[Right]
Marth has very little backup.[N]
If we can destroy this army,[AN]
any help of his will have to[N]
come across the sea.[AN]
We have naval superiority, so[N]
we can hold Akaneia off.[AN]
[FR]
Remember, Marth only tore through[N]
northwestern Sofia. If we can[AN]
contact the westen Rigel armies,[N]
we could hit him with a pincer.[AN]
[FL]
The troops guarding the south[N]
gate are still intact, your[AN]
majesty. They can relieve us[N]
immediately. I doubt this is[AN]
going to end in a siege.[N]
The walls are already breached.[AN]
[Left]
Gramps, you're right. Those[N]
troops need to cut Marth off.[AN]
Set up as many barricades as[N]
possible inside the castle.[AN]
We need to buy every second[N]
of time we can. Rigel is a[AN]
week's ride away. We can't[N]
hold out for that long.[AN]
Sofia Port is two days' ride.[N]
That's still unlikely.[AN]
[FR]
Once we got rolling, we never[N]
really stopped. How do we[AN]
fight defensively? I'm going[N]
to be honest: I don't know.[AN]
[FL]
This situation is grim. But I[N]
must say, I do not agree with[AN]
this morning's declaration.[N]
This could destroy everything[AN]
we have ever held dear in one[N]
day. Anteze, why?[AN]
Your demeanour is much more[N]
aggressive. You would never[AN]
have approved of this war.[N]
What changed with you?[AN]
[Right]
[Beat][A]
[FL]
No answer? Alm, you give me[N]
an answer, then. Do you[AN]
not think anything is off?[N]
Anything at all?[AN]
[Left]
What are you implying, Gramps?[N]
That Celica is wrong?[AN]
[FL]
She didn't even acknowledge her[N]
actual name! Celica is just[AN]
a nickname, one that she goes[N]
by often, but a nickname![AN]
Forget it. I cannot condone[N]
this war. I will fight it,[AN]
but know this is a mistake.[N]
Alm, please sue for peace.[AN]
[Right]
Peace? It's too late. I thought[N]
we could easily defeat Marth.[AN]
What... have I done? I... need[N]
to go. I need a minute.[A]
//if you get her perma-engaged have it flicker a bit here
[MoveFarFarLeft][Clear]
[FR]
Did Celica's hair just... flash[N]
blonde for an instant?[AN]
Nah, I must be seeing things.[N]
Speaking of Celica, anyone[AN]
seen her buddies around lately?[N]
You'd think May and Boey would[AN]
have dropped by to see her.[N]
Wonder what's taking them?[AN]
[Left]
Weather around Nova's been[N]
terrible recently.[AN]
Can't go anywhere, or so I[N]
hear. I hope it lets up.[AN]
The castle is full of our[N]
finest: I can only hope[AN]
they can hold Marth off.[N]
We need help. I'll take[AN]
it from anywhere. Otherwise,[N]
this is Valencia's last[AN]
stand. I'm going down with[N]
the ship if necessary.[AN]
[FL]
Your majesty, you can't![N]
You must live to fight on.[AN]
[Left]
I got us in this mess. Running[N]
away isn't going to help.[AN]
Now, where's Celica gone? We[N]
need to plan the balcony defence.[AN][X]
