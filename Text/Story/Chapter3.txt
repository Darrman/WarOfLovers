His next destination is Samsufe Peak, a[N]
towering mountain to the east.[AN]
Since time immemorial, bandits have infested[N]
the region, leading to the local population[AN]
to nickname it Devil Mountain. Even now,[N]
the Samsian bandits roam the mountainside.[AN]
Kris only despatched a small division, and[N]
that division co-exists with the Samsians.[AN]
To the south, Marth faces Kris's division.[N]
To the north, Chiki eyes Samsian axes.[AN]
One thing is for certain: blood will spill[N]
on the hills of Devil Mountain.[A][X]

Emblems Lucina and Lyn are dead.[AN]
Worse still, the Emblem Chiki project[N]

He was my first Emblem. My favourite[AN]
Emblem. I value my many engagements,[N]

of his friends and we could all be[AN]

There hasn't been too much fighting[N]

Devil Mountain is called that[N]
for a reason: the bandits just[AN]

Ladies and gentlemen. Today, a great[N]

Marich has been defeated and captured.[N]
The justice system will deal with him[AN]
in due course. I also have some very[N]
important information. As you know,[AN]
I am the Captain of Emperor Marth's[N]
Royal Guard, an important position.[AN]
I have received news of the Emperor.[N]
We have waited two long years...[AN]

Ahem. Emperor Marth has relocated to[N]
the land of Lythos, situated on the[AN]
continent of Elyos. He is also happily[N]
married to Alear, its queen.[AN]
The Emperor is content in Lythos,[N]
and has no interest in returning[AN]
to Akaneia. Here with me today is[N]
Queen Alear of Lythos.[AN]
[FR]
Hello everybody. I am Alear,[N]
queen of Lythos and Marth's wife.[A]
[Left]
Thank you. Now, I have an important[N]
truth to reveal. In my capacity as[AN]
Captain of the Royal Guards, the[N]
Emperor entrusted me alone with[AN]
his plans to move to Lythos to be[N]
with Alear. As he lacked any heir,[AN]
he entrusted me with the Akaneian[N]
Empire. The only condition was[AN]
to allow him return to the throne[N]
if he ever returned to Akaneia.[AN]
Alear has brought with her today[N]
both written confirmation of[AN]
Marth's abdication, effective[N]
midnight tonight, but his final[AN]
imperial edict. Your Majesty,[N]
if you may?[AN]
[FR]
Gladly, Kris. This is Marth's[N]
final message. He sent me to[AN]
Akaneia to deliver it to his[N]
people on his behalf.[A][X]
