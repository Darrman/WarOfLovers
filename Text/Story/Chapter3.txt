## Ch3WorldMap
Marth has crossed Lefcandy and left[N]
Akaneia proper. His next destination[AN]
is Devil Mountain, a towering peak[N]
to Marth's east. Kris's faction has[N]
a force here, but the local bandits[AN]
still retain a sizeable amount of[N]
control. Marth and Chiki stare down[AN]
a combination of the Samsian bandits,[N]
Kris's division, and Lythos influence...[A][X]

Divine One, I bring you bad news.[N]
Emblems Lucina and Lyn are dead.[AN]
Worse still, the Emblem Chiki project[N]
has been ruined: the intended ring[AN]
has gone missing and somehow Chiki[N]
appears to be free from any control.[A]
[MR]
Vander, why? Why did Marth leave me?[N]
He was my first Emblem. My favourite[AN]
Emblem. I value my many engagements,[N]
but I wanted even more! I wanted a[AN]
wedding! And then I could collect some[N]
of his friends and we could all be[AN]
one big happy family. But no! His[N]
memory just had to come back! How?[AN]
He just had to have met another girl[N]
over a decade ago! And then... he[AN]
went and fell in love with her! And[N]
then he went and married her! Waa...[AN]
Vander, what does Sheeda have that I[N]
don't? I just do not understand![AN]
[ML]
I also do not understand, milady.[N]
You are the Divine One, lacking any[AN]
possible flaws. Why Marth would leave[N]
you behind is a complete mystery.[AN]
By the way, your meeting with Captain[N]

Oh right, of course.[N]

Greetings, Lady Alear. I have Pales[N]
surrounded. That weakling Marich[AN]
has been given an ultimatum. So long[N]
as he surrenders by sundown, I've won.[AN]
That will get me the propaganda, too.[N]
Marth wouldn't want him to fight.[AN]
[Left]
Good work, Kris. Your propaganda[N]
machine is very impressive.[AN]
Your propaganda machine and my cult[N]

There is a flaw, however: Marth.[N]
He escaped from you recently...[AN]
He's been making a habit of getting[N]
into combat engagements with my[AN]
troops. Nothing especially severe,[N]
but my faction is not happy.[AN]
Being a Marth loyalist is difficult[N]
if you won't give your throne back[AN]

Devil Mountain is called that[N]
for a reason: the bandits just[AN]
never go away! One of the two big[N]
Akaneian factions sent a division[AN]
to keep the peace, but it's not[N]
doing a very good job. Beware of[AN]
the bandits, traveller: many have[N]
wound up on the end of an axe.[A][X]

I heard Marth returned! But everyone[N]
seems to give a different name for[AN]
who he returned with. A lot say he's[N]
going out with Katua now. Some say[AN]
he's courting Malliesia these days.[N]
There's a bunch of nonsense in terms[AN]
of him and Chiki too. For all I know,[N]
he's actually still loyal to Sheeda![A][X]

I can't stand all the instability[N]
here in Akaneia! Everyone keeps[AN]

stupid like who sits on a chair.[AN]
As soon as I can, I'm packing up[N]
and moving to Valencia. It's just[AN]
a single, united island country.[N]
No wars, no strife, all peace.[AN]
King Alm and Queen Celica aren't[N]

Luke was part of the same platoon[N]

Marth, what kind of person[N]
was Luke? Was he nice?[A]

He... was full of himself. He thought[N]
he'd be the greatest knight Aritia[AN]

Heroes, he ended up resigning.[A]

So... that means Kris gave him a[N]
job again? So he could be a knight?[AN]

Ladies and gentlemen. Today, a great[N]
event in Akaneia's history occured.[AN]
Marich has been defeated and captured.[N]
The justice system will deal with him[AN]
in due course. I also have some very[N]
important information. As you know,[AN]
I am the Captain of Emperor Marth's[N]
Royal Guard, an important position.[AN]
I have received news of the Emperor.[N]
We have waited two long years...[AN]
[FFR][MoveFarRight]
[Left]
Ahem. Emperor Marth has relocated to[N]
the land of Lythos, situated on the[AN]
continent of Elyos. He is also happily[N]
married to Alear, its queen.[AN]
The Emperor is content in Lythos,[N]
and has no interest in returning[AN]
to Akaneia. Here with me today is[N]
Queen Alear of Lythos.[AN]
[FR]
Hello everybody. I am Alear,[N]
queen of Lythos and Marth's wife.[A]
[Left]
Thank you. Now, I have an important[N]
truth to reveal. In my capacity as[AN]
Captain of the Royal Guards, the[N]
Emperor entrusted me alone with[AN]
his plans to move to Lythos to be[N]
with Alear. As he lacked any heir,[AN]
he entrusted me with the Akaneian[N]
Empire. The only condition was[AN]
to allow him return to the throne[N]
if he ever returned to Akaneia.[AN]
Alear has brought with her today[N]
both written confirmation of[AN]
Marth's abdication, effective[N]
midnight tonight, but his final[AN]
imperial edict. Your Majesty,[N]
if you may?[AN]
[FR]
Gladly, Kris. This is Marth's[N]
final message. He sent me to[AN]
Akaneia to deliver it to his[N]
people on his behalf.[A][X]

## Ch3MarthAbdicationNote
"I, Marth Lowell, Emperor of Akaneia,[N]
hereby declare that I, and my heirs[N]
and successors, do abdicate the[N]
throne of the Akaneian Empire to[N]
Captain Kris, Aritian Royal Guard.[AN]
This abdication will take effect on[N]
the 15th of July, 614, on the stroke[N]
of midnight."[A][X]

## Ch3ImperialEdict
"Imperial Edict: I, Marth Lowell,[N]
Emperor of Akaneia, hereby declare[N]
Sheeda of Talis is no longer my wife.[AN]
She is a traitor to the Empire, and[N]
must be captured as soon as possible.[N]
Any who capture her will be well-rewarded.[AN]
However, she must be captured alive.[N]
Any who provide her shelter or aid are[N]
also traitors to the Empire."[A][X]

## Ch3SpeechEnd

[Left]
I graciously accept the throne in[N]
place of Emperor Marth. It is a[AN]
a shame that he could not be in[N]
attendance today...[AN]
[FR]
He wants nothing more than to rest[N]
in Lythos. I am sure you understand.[AN]
[Left]
I will also declare that supporters[N]
of the defeated Marich faction who[AN]
do not surrender within the next day[N]
to also be traitors, and are to be[AN]
punished with the full force of the[N]
Akaneian army. The same goes to all[AN]
independence rebels, who will be[N]
crushed systematically if you do not[AN]
surrender immediately.[N]
Thank you, people of Akaneia![AN]
[FFL]
Long live Emperor Kris![N]
Long may he reign![A][X]
