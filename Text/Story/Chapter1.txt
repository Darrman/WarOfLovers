The continent of Akaneia.[AN]
Upon the defeat of the Dark Dragon[N]
Mediuth in the year 608,[AN]
the hero Marth unified the continent[N]
under his rule.[AN]
Seven kingdoms became one, and the[N]
preperations were long and difficult.[AN]
By 609 the preperations were complete,[N]
and Marth was crowned Emperor of Akaneia.[AN]
He also married his beloved wife,[N]
Sheeda of Talis, making her Empress.[AN]
The couple aimed to maintain peace and[N]
lead the war-torn continent to stability.[AN]
With the support of figures such as Marich,[N]
Marth's brother-in-law,[AN]
and Chiki, princess of the Divine Dragon[N]
tribe, the empire prospered for three years.[AN]
However, one day, Akaneia woke up to find[N]
Marth had simply vanished.[AN]
Nobody had any idea where he had gone.[N]
He was the glue that held Akaneia together.[AN]
Without him, the united continent was doomed.[AN]

Unknown to anyone in Akaneia, Marth found[N]
himself courting Alear, a Divine Dragon[AN]
residing in the far-flung kingdom of Lythos,[N]
situated on the continent of Elyos.[AN]
Two years have passed, and the courtship[N]
became an engagement.[AN]
It is now 614, by Akaneia's reckoning.[N]
Wedding bells are ringing in Lythos...[A][X]

//All this stuff is old
[MR][LoadMarth]
So, the day has finally come.[N]
We're not just going to be[AN]
engaged. Alear and I will be[N]
wed at last. Funny how we[AN]
get engaged almost instantly,[N]
yet it takes so much longer[AN]
to actually get married. I[N]
can hardly begrudge her the[AN]
ceremony. I shouldn't keep[N]
her waiting much longer.[A]
[FFL][LoadGoon][MoveMidLeft]
Ah, Emblem Marth. As you know,[N]
there are the twelve Emblems.[AN]
However, the Divine One has[N]
recently discovered that there[AN]
are many more Emblem Rings in[N]
the world. The details are[AN]
scarce, but they hold great[N]
power. If the Divine One[AN]
engages with them, she could[N]
grow even more powerful.[AN]
Emblem Marth, is there anyone[N]
from Akaneia you want to see?[AN]
[MR]
My apologies, Vander. It is[N]
as if my life began when I first[AN]
met Alear. I've witnessed many[N]
a summoning, and I know our[AN]
friends in Askr call forth many[N]
Akaneians. I've done some work[AN]
in the Order of Heroes. The people[N]
of Askr are wonderful, and I'd[AN]
hate to see them come to harm.[N]
But there's nobody I'd especially[N]
want to reunite with in Lythos.[A]
[ML]
Well Marth, the Divine One has reason[N]
to believe one of the extra Emblems[AN]
is Akaneian. Perhaps you'll be friends.[N]
Anyway, I am to officiate. Goodbye,[AN]
Emblem Marth, and may you and the Divine[N]
One live a long and happy life.[A][X]

## Ch1OpeningAnnaVisits

Hmm... I wonder who it could be?[N]

Oh, hi there! This place is huge. I[N]
can't tell you about the details,[AN]
but since you've paid my secret[N]
shops plenty of visits, I'll let[AN]
you in on a secret. Your new girl[N]
paid me big money to get this ring[AN]
made, and as far as I know it's[N]
not even your wedding ring![AN]
[MR]
"New" girl? I've only ever been[N]
engaged to Alear! What do you[AN]

Calm down, I mistook you for someone[N]
else. I'm sorry about that. Anyway,[AN]

//at the Order and guessing who the[AN]

//someone there has, the better.[AN]
//There's been a bit of an exodus from[N]

In addition, we plan to summon[N]

I, the Divine One Alear, take you,[N]
Emblem Marth, to be my husband.[AN]
I promise to be true to you in good[N]

With the exchange of the vows,[N]
there is but one question.[AN]
If this couple should not be[N]

The only Emblem I know is the[N]

And the main reason this[AN]
marriage should not go ahead[N]
is that I am already married![AN]

I am married to Sheeda![AN]

It's hard to believe it's almost[N]

The preperations are going perfectly.[N]
Alear, tomorrow will be a great day.[AN]
[MR]
Indeed it will, Marth. I'm so happy[N]
we can finally be married.[AN]
We've been engaged from the day I[N]
woke up from my slumber.[AN]
But I can't just settle for that.[N]
Give me holy matrimony![AN]
[ML]
And I'll happily take it. This is[N]
going to be the biggest ceremony[AN]
Elyos has ever seen. Representatives[N]
from Firene, Brodia, Elusia, Solm...[AN]
The subjects of Lythos... even the[N]
Emblems. I hope everything works out.[AN]
[MR]
I've been keeping this a secret, but[N]
I think I can give you a hint, Marth.[AN]
There are more Emblem Rings than the[N]
twelve in Lythos. Before the wedding,[AN]
I think we'll introduce her to Elyos.[N]
Marth, how about you take a moment to[AN]
guess who she might be? My only other[N]
hint is she's an Akaneian like you![AN]
[ML]
Akaneian... Have you found Empress[N]
Nina, my predecessor to the throne?[AN]
[MR]
No, it's not her.[N]
Want another guess?[AN]
[ML]
Hm, Linda? Or Midia? Anna?[N]
Wait, you mean the continent.[AN]
[MR]
You're the one who unified[N]
Akaneia! What's the difference?[AN]
But that doesn't really matter.[N]
How about one last guess?[A]
[ML]
Hm... Well, it all started when...[N]
...what is her name... told me[AN]
there was an attack. We were on[N]
Talis... Later on, ...someone...[AN]
recruited a lot of allies to the[N]
cause. She was very important...[AN]
Then there was... um, a messenger[N]
told me Hardin had conquered[AN]
Aritia during the War of Heroes.[N]
Oh, I give up. I've forgotten.[AN]
[MR]
...Are you alright, Marth? Look,[N]
you must be tired. Get some sleep.[AN]
You'll find out who the Emblem is[N]
tomorrow. And then, marriage![AN]
[ML]
Alear... Why wait? We can introduce[N]
the Emblem to Elyos as a married[AN]
couple. That will be so much more[N]
romantic. Don't you agree?[A]
[MR]
Of course! We can put the wedding[N]
first. That's the star attraction![AN]
Now let's get some rest. Tomorrow[N]
is a very big day for us![A][X]

I am in attendance as well, just[N]
in case anything happens to Alfred.[A]

Well, I trust nothing bad will[N]
happen, Princess Celine. I know[AN]
how fond you are of tea - do you[N]
want to share a cup?[AN]

Of course, Lord Marth. After all, the[N]

Hello. I'm... passing through the[N]
area. Could you fill me in?[AN]
[ML]
Well you must have been living[N]
under a rock, lad.[AN]
Ever since the emperor up and[N]
vanished, Akaneia's been[AN]
falling apart. He was beyond[N]
naive thinking you could merge[AN]
seven kingdoms into one. Anyway,[N]
there's two main factions.[AN]
The empress took off looking for[N]
her husband, leaving Princess[AN]
Ellis nominally in charge. She[N]
then had her husband Marich run[AN]
things. But at the same time,[N]
a portion of the army claimed[AN]
that Marth had given this army[N]
officer by the name of Kris[AN]
the throne in his absence.[N]
They've been fighting for the[AN]
best part of two years now.[N]
So there it is, lad.[AN]
[MR]
...What a disaster...[N]
Who's winning?[AN]
[ML]
Tough call. Rural areas like Kris.[N]
The towns prefer Marich. Outside[AN]
Akaneia proper, I couldn't tell[N]
you. Warren's a Marich town.[AN]
A traveller like you shouldn't[N]
hang around, though.[AN]
This place will be a battlefield[N]

[MR]
Thank you for the warning. One[N]
last question: do you know where[AN]
the empress is? I know you said[N]
she went looking for the emperor.[AN]
[ML]
The rumour mill says Sheeda went[N]
back home eventually.[AN]
She's from Talis, which still is[N]
a backwater at the end of the day.[AN]

My ship's been sunk, so I can't just[N]
leave quietly...[A][X]

## Ch1AnnaSummonsAnArmy
[ML][LoadAnna][MR][LoadMarth]
So Kris has sent an army to attack[N]
Warren. I can't fight alone.[AN]
Did your summoning plan work?[AN]
[ML]
I think it did, anyway. According[N]
to the instruction booklet, it[AN]
summons people from throughout[N]
time and space, with no limitations.[AN]
[MR]
You don't need to sell me on it,[N]
I'm already using it![AN]
[ML]
Right, sorry. Anyway, all you have[N]
to do is push this button.[AN]
You'll summon five people at once.[N]
You probably won't know of them...[AN][X]

## Ch1AfterSummoning
[ML][LoadAnna][MR][LoadMarth]
Well... it worked.[N]
Any side effects?[A]
[ML]
Well, any time you do anything[N]
particularly noteworthy,[AN]
someone else will be summoned.[N]
I'm not sure about the effects[AN]
on these people's homelands.[N]
You should be able to fight[AN]
your way out of Warren now.[N]
Good luck Marth, and come again![A][X]

Kris claims to be the head of the[N]
Aritian Royal Guard, but I don't[AN]
believe him for a second. Hardin[N]
did many things, but there were[AN]
never any assassins. He suggests[N]
the assassins started attacking[AN]
before Hardin even became the[N]
Dark Emperor! What a chancer.[A][X]

## Ch1House2Text

I never liked Marth. Akaneia had[N]
been doing just fine for 600[AN]
years with its own royal family.[N]
Then Durhua just had to mess it[AN]
all up. Then Princess Nina had[N]
to marry that lovesick fool Hardin.[AN]
Still, Nina was the last of the[N]
royal family. Boa meant well.[AN]
Then Hardin lost the war, Nina[N]
vanished, and we ended up with[AN]
a soft-hearted Aritian and his[N]
girlfriend from who-knows-where[AN]
squatting in Pales. And now they've[N]
run off and Akaneia's in a civil[AN]
war. So yeah. I don't like Marth.[N]
He makes me sick.[AN][X]

## Ch1House3Text
[ML][LoadFace][0x61][0x01][MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML]
Marich and Princess Ellis have[N]
been running a school for magic[AN]
within the walls of Pales.[N]
I'm concerned about what Kris[AN]
will do to it if he wins.[N]
He doesn't have a magical bone[AN]
in his body. I know someone[N]
there, and it would really set[AN]
her back to send her to Khadein.[N]
Oh, I hope things work out...[A][X]

## Ch1House4Text
[ML][LoadFace][0x62][0x01][MR][LoadCurrent]

Emperor Marth was always very kind.[N]
He would always give somebody a[AN]
second chance if they opposed him.[N]
This is why so many from all over[AN]
the world fought for him. Nobody[N]
else could unify Akaneia in the way[AN]
Marth did. But then he disappeared,[N]
and that dream died with him.[AN]
Marich is like Marth, but he doesn't[N]
have the personal sway to keep the[AN]
rest of the continent in line.[N]
Kris? I've always felt a sense of[AN]
warmongering in his actions. Always[N]
training, always fighting.[AN]
I'm afraid of what he'd do if he[N]
took Pales. If he controlled Chiki...[A][X]

## Ch1KrisArrives
[ML][LoadKris]
Hmph. Have my men not seized[N]
Warren yet? Fine. I'll do it[AN]
myself if I have to. My training[N]
should prove very useful.[A][X]

## Ch1Ending
[MR][LoadMarth]
//Everything with emblem autonomy needs to be rewritten
Phew... I did it. Lucina was one of[N]
Alear's other "Emblems". That can[AN]
only mean that Alear and Kris are[N]
in contact somehow. But I need to[AN]
get to Talis. I could intervene[N]
on Marich's behalf, but I'd never[AN]
make it to Pales. That, and west[N]
of here is an active battlefield.[AN]
Peraty has been unstable for a long[N]
time. I doubt there'd be any help[AN]
for me if I returned there after[N]
I went in and toppled the king.[AN]
I believe the way forward is to[N]
retrace my steps in the War of[AN]
Darkness. I will head north, to[N]
Lefcandy. From there, I will[AN]
turn east, cross Devil Mountain,[N]
and arrive in Garda. Then, I[AN]
will get a boat to Talis, and[N]
hopefully find Sheeda again.[A][X]

## Ch1EndingNew
[MR][LoadMarth]
Caesar... We fought together to[N]
defend Port Warren before. Now[AN]
he dies attacking it. I don't[N]
like killing former allies,[AN]
but in this situation, there is[N]
no choice at all... I need to[AN]
get to Talis. I could intervene[N]
on Marich's behalf, but I'd never[AN]
make it to Pales. That, and west[N]
of here is an active battlefield.[AN]
Peraty has been unstable for a long[N]
