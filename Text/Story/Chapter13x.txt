## Ch13xWorldMap
While awaiting a response from Alm,[N]
Marth's army marches to Fear Mountain.[AN]
Fear Mountain more than earned its[N]
name: it is home to many terrifying[AN]
monsters and witches. During Alm's[N]
war, the wicked Nuibaba had taken[AN]
up residence in a manor near the[N]
summit. Despite an evil contract,[AN]
Alm prevailed and rescued a cleric[N]
named Teeta. This intertwined with[AN]
romantic complications that had a[N]
major role in triggering the War of[AN]
Heroes far to the east of Valencia.[N]
//I won't recap FE3 here, it comes up again
The red string of fate continues to[AN]
dangle, consuming ever-more people and[N]
places in its wake...[A][X]

## Ch13xAFewDaysAgo
A few days ago...[X]

## Ch13xOpeningHeartbreak
//Maybe this should be a flashback somewhere: Teeta really should be present
//to rub it in
[Left][LoadCamus][MR][LoadNina]
[Left]
Hello, milady. How[N]
may I help you?[AN]
[MR]
Camus! It's you! I finally found[N]
you! It's been years and years...[AN]
I know it was you at the Dragons'[N]
Altar. I know you were behind the[AN]
mask. Sirius, Camus... it doesn't[N]
matter. I've finally found you![AN]
[Left]
//Direct FE3 quotation
Milady... I think you're mistaken.[N]
I am Zeke, a knight of Valencia.[AN]
I don't know anybody called Camus.[N]
Or Sirius, for that matter...[AN]
[MR]
Those were the exact same words[N]
you said back then![AN]
You appeared in my darkest hour...[N]
just to deny who you are![AN]
[Left]
Do you need to rest? I'm sure you[N]
have had a long journey.[AN]
[MR]
My journey has finally ended! What[N]
I need is to be with you, Camus![AN]
[Left]
...I really don't want to have to[N]
explain this. Nina, forget me.[AN]
Letting me consume you like this[N]
is not healthy at all.[AN]
[MR]
But I can't. Without you, I would[N]
have died long, long ago.[AN]
[Left]
In another life, it would have been[N]
wonderful. But that is impossible.[AN]
I've started a new life, a new family.[N]
One without the baggage of Akaneia.[AN]
[FL][LoadTeeta]
Ezekiel? Who are you talking to?[N]
Ooh, she looks fancy. And important![AN]
[MR]
Who are you? Who are you?[N]
Camus, who is she?![AN]
[Left]
Nina, this is Teeta.[N]
[......]My wife.[A]
[MR]
Your... wife. Wife. You're[N]
married. Was it arranged?[AN]
[FL]
Well, it all started when I found[N]
him washed up on the beach.[AN]
Actually, I think he did mutter[N]
"Nina" when he first came to...[AN]
Anyway, he was badly wounded, so[N]
I nursed him back to health.[AN]
I won't get into the details, but[N]
Emperor Rudolf actually named[AN]
him Zeke because he had forgotten[N]
his original name. I call him[AN]
Ezekiel though, it's more dignified.[N]
I don't really know much about[AN]
what happened before Ezekiel[N]
washed up here, actually.[AN]
//Now, Camus says nothing. I am applying exact words here. Nina tells all.
[MR]
Sniff... You really do love her,[N]
don't you, Camus?[AN]
You're a lucky woman. The first[N]
time I met Camus, he was a[AN]
general of Grunia, head of an[N]
elite unit of their army.[AN]
But although he always followed[N]
his orders, he treated me as[AN]
well as he could, even though I[N]
was a prisoner of Durhua.[AN]
He actually spirited me away from[N]
Pales into the care of Hardin.[AN]
Oh, Hardin... He loved me too...[N]
But I simply didn't feel the[AN]
same way. It really was such a[N]
rotten situation, you know.[AN]
[FL]
Ezekiel, I have no idea what[N]
she's talking about.[AN]
Grunia? Where's that? Wait, I[N]
think it's on Akaneia.[AN]
I couldn't point it out on a[N]
map though. Have you been?[AN]
[Left]
Just let Nina get everything off[N]
her chest... She needs to.[AN]
[MR]
So Hardin protected me for a[N]
while until Lord Marth came.[AN]
Then they both turned the tide[N]
against Durhua... Oh...[AN]
Then came that fateful day...[N]
Marth's army faced you![AN]
I wanted you to surrender.[N]
Marth tried his best.[AN]
But that's not how you are.[N]
You're always loyal, no matter[AN]
what happens. If we found a way[N]
around you, none of this would[AN]
have happened! No War of Heroes![N]
Hardin would have stayed a good[AN]
person! We'd be happy! It would[N]
be so perfectly wonderful...[AN]
[Left]
Nina... The people of Akaneia would[N]
never accept me as their king.[AN]
It would simply be impossible.[N]
There would be uproar... Rebellion.[AN]
[MR]
Boa insisted I had to marry either[N]
Marth or Hardin. If I married[AN]
Marth... broke him and Sheeda up...[N]
what could have happened?[AN]
Could he have been corrupted by[N]
the Dark Orb, as Hardin was?[AN]
If I could have married any man,[N]
if I knew you were alive--[AN]
[Left]
Nina. I am sorry for everything.[N]
But it wouldn't have worked.[AN]
Perhaps you could have married[N]
a minor noble, or nobody.[AN]
Any other choice would be better[N]
than an enemy general.[AN]
What's done is done. I'm happy[N]
here with Teeta. I cannot be[AN]
seen in Akaneia. I'm sorry that[N]
it's come to this.[AN]
[MR]
...I understand. Forgive me for[N]
interrupting you.[AN]
Have a nice day. Sniff...[N]
Sniff... Waahh...[A][Clear]
[FL]
Oh my... Ezekiel, is all of[N]
this true? Is she okay?[AN]
[Left]
...[A][X]

## Ch13xOpeningAtFearMountain
[FL][LoadChiki][Left][LoadMarth][MR][LoadValbo]
This is Fear Mountain. Sir Zeke[N]
will be with us shortly.[AN]
Our objective is to secure[N]
Nuibaba's Manor, north of here.[AN]
Nuibaba's long dead, of course,[N]
but what else do we call it?[AN]
[Left]
This place looks rotten. Does[N]
anything grow around here?[AN]
[MR]
Mostly zombies and skeletons.[N]
Human remains are bad enough,[AN]
//Pun somewhat intended
but the real terrors are the[N]
dragon zombies.[AN]
[FL]
...Dragon zombies? Eek... What[N]
do you mean by that?[AN]
[MR]
Exactly what it sounds like. Never[N]
seen a living one around here.[AN]
Decaying flesh, nasty bite,[N]
if you see one, run for it.[AN]
[FL]
I've never heard of that[N]
happening to a dragon...[AN]
Marth... I'm scared.[N]
Does this happen on Akaneia?[AN]
[Left]
Is this the ultimate endpoint[N]
of degeneration?[AN]
[MR]
Oh, here's Zeke now. Took[N]
him long enough, I say.[A][X]

## Ch13xOpeningUncomfortableReunion
[Left][LoadMarth][Right][LoadCamus][FR][LoadValbo]
[FR]
Excellent. Lord Marth, Sir[N]
Zeke. Sir Zeke, Lord Marth.[AN]
[Right][ToggleMouthMove]
(Of all the people... Marth?[N]
First Nina, now Marth.[AN]
Two prominent Akaneians in[N]
such a short time...)[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
It is an honour, sir. We[N]
are aiming to retake[AN]
Nuibaba's Manor from a[N]
proscribed institution,[AN]
the old Doma Faithful.[N]
The Doma and Mila faiths[AN]
have been unified recently,[N]
but some refuse to comply.[AN]
Emperor Alm desires their[N]
eradication, but I required[AN]
some reinforcements before[N]
I could launch an attack.[AN]
[Left]
I see. We were informed that[N]
a prominent woman travelled[AN]
into this area alone, and[N]
that she may require aid.[AN]
[Right]
//Nina... Ahem. Never mind.[N]
We should protect any innocents caught[N]
up in this battle. May we prevail.[A][Clear]
[Left][ToggleMouthMove]
(He is Camus. He seems to be[N]
pretending not to know me,[AN]
so I'll pretend not to know[N]
him. It should be simpler.)[A][X]

## Ch13xOpeningThisIsNoFairyTale
[FL][LoadNina]
What are these things? The[N]
dead have risen from their[AN]
graves. I swear I saw a[N]
rotten dragon in a building.[AN]
There are floating eyeballs.[N]
What forsaken place is this?[AN]
[FR][LoadChloe]
She's clearly not part of the[N]
Doma Faithful. I should just[AN]
leave her alone, but she seems[N]
so miserable. I doubt Emblem[AN]
Marth has any connection to[N]
her, either. No fairy tale[AN]
would just leave her stranded.[N]
So... I think I'll do this.[AN]
[MoveMidRight]
Hey! Get out of here! It's[N]
too dangerous![AN]
[FL]
I would if I could! But I'm[N]
cornered by these... things![AN]
[MR]
Ah, the Corrupted... Well,[N]
I'm sure a battle will begin[AN]
soon. Look, take this. It[N]
should keep you alive.[AN]
I can't do anything else.[N]
I hope a knight in shining[AN]
armour sweeps you off your[N]
feet soon! Bye![A][X]

## Ch13xOpeningTheCultPlans
[MR][LoadChloe][ML][LoadDomaMinion]
[MR]
(CULTIST), a Valencian unit is[N]
approaching us from the south.[AN]
[ML]
Excellent. All this funding[N]
your people are giving us[AN]
is working wonders for our[N]
plans. Only Doma is fit to[AN]
rule over Valencia. Not Mila,[N]
and certainly not that Alm![AN]
You know what to do. Once the[N]
enemy draw near, swoop on[AN]
down and wipe them out! May[N]
Doma's blessings be with you.[AN][X]

## Ch13xAfterPrepEvilLaughter
[ML][LoadDomaMinion]
Ha ha... She doesn't know, does she?[N]
That artist friend of hers forgot[AN]
this ring behind him a while ago.[N]
I think it's a good time to see[AN]
if these rings are as strong as[N]
the Elyosians let on.[AN]
Even if it doesn't, the magic of[N]
Messiah is as mighty as ever.[A][X]

## Ch13xAfterPrepSummonTutorial
[ML][LoadMarth][MR][LoadCamus]
One piece of advice, sir.[N]
It is likely the enemy[AN]
has summoned many monsters.[N]
If you kill the summoner,[AN]
this will also destroy all[N]
the monsters he summoned.[AN]
If a chance ever opens up,[N]
attack the summoner first.[A][X]

## Ch13xSavingNinaMarth
[MR][LoadMarth][ML][LoadNina]
Emperor Marth? Why are you here?[N]
What reason do you have to visit[AN]
such a worthless wasteland?[N]
Just leave me alone. What do I[AN]
have to live for now? Camus is[N]
married now. I abdicated Akaneia[AN]
to you. I have no dreams, and I[N]
have no responsibilities.[AN]
[MR]
Lady Nina, you shouldn't dwell[N]
on the same thing forever.[AN]
If you have no dreams, then[N]
find a new dream to chase.[AN]
[ML]
That's easy for you to say.[N]
You and Sheeda are happily[AN]
married. You don't have to[N]
deal with a broken heart.[AN]
[MR]
Yes, but... that doesn't matter.[N]
Nina, you must survive.[AN]
We will protect you for as long[N]
as necessary.[AN]
[ML]
No... There's no need for that.[N]
Akaneia is in your hands now.[AN]
[MR]
Just how long have you been[N]
searching for Camus?[AN]
Do you have any idea what's[N]
going on in Akaneia now?[AN]
[ML]
Five years, at least? I haven't[N]
been on Akaneia for a long while.[AN]
[MR]
Never mind. I won't try to[N]
persuade you to do anything.[AN]
Just... keep yourself safe.[N]
Don't throw your life away.[A][X]

## Ch13xSparingChloe
[ML][LoadChloe][MR][LoadMarth]
Chloe, correct? I found this[N]
in one of the forts nearby.[AN]
[ML]
That's Venomous! Firene's holy[N]
lance! How did you get that?![AN]
[MR]
It was lying around in a fort.[N]
Now, I believe this is yours.[AN]
[ML]
...You're giving it back?[N]
What's the catch, them?[AN]
[MR]
It's not an Aritian spear. It's[N]
a Firenese one. I've no right[AN]
to keep this. So here you go.[AN]
[ML]
Wow... I thought we had lost[N]
it. We had it inside the manor.[AN]
You said it was in a fort outside?[N]
I see... This isn't over, but[AN]
as a token of my appreciation...[N]
I'm going to retreat.[AN]
Thank you, Emblem Marth. Truly.[N]
Your kindness... surprises me.[A][X]

## Ch13xEndingNinaSaved
[ML][LoadNina][MR][LoadMarth]
Lady Nina, are you well?[N]
I appreciate that--[AN]
[ML]
No. But you deserve something.[N]
But I don't have anything.[AN]
[MR]
That's fine. Your safety is[N]
enough for me. But now what?[AN]
[ML]
I don't know. This world is a[N]
big one, but perhaps there[AN]
is something for me out there.[N]
But... I don't know for sure.[AN]
If nothing else... I have closure.[N]
I have to move on, somehow.[AN]
[MR]
Well, please stay safe.[N]
Farewell, Nina.[A]
[ML][Clear][LoadCamus]
//Well, this sure is phoned in. Argh, writer's block...
So... we succeed in saving her.[N]
Good. So, sir, what brings you[AN]
here to Valencia? I understand[N]
you sailed in from the west?[AN]
[MR]
Correct. We're aiming to pass[N]
through Valencia quickly to[AN]
make it back to Akaneia.[AN]
[ML]
I see. With the enemy forces[N]
cleaned out of the manor,[AN]
my duty has been completed.[N]
Until I receive new orders,[AN]
I will accompany you for the[N]
time being.[AN]
[MR]
I see. Thank you, Zeke.[N]
Let us fight together.[A][X]

## Ch13xEndingNinaDies
[ML][LoadCamus][MR][LoadValbo]
[ML]
Sir Valbo... I failed. Tell[N]
Emperor Alm this: I resign.[AN]
I am not worthy to be in[N]
his service.[AN]
[MR]
You resign? Why? We won the battle.[N]
Why do you say you're unworthy?[AN]
[ML]
I... it's very complicated. But[N]
if I can't protect Nina...[AN]
then I can't protect anyone.[N]
I may love Teeta, but that[AN]
doesn't mean I want Nina to[N]
suffer either. Her dying...[AN]
It's my fault. I can't have[N]
that on my consience.[AN]
[MR]
I... I see. When we meet[N]
his majesty, I will let[AN]
him know. Thank you, Zeke.[N]
I hope you and Teeta are[AN]
happy, and you have given[N]
Valencia good service.[A][X]

## Ch13xEndingAnotherRingFound
[ML][LoadMarth][MR][LoadSheeda]
Marth, we've found another[N]
ring on the enemy commander.[AN]
I don't think he's Elyosian.[N]
Did he borrow the ring?[AN]
[ML]
This doesn't matter: this[N]
ring is ours now.[AN]
The Ring of the Azure Twin,[N]
Eirika...[AN][X]

## Ch13xEndingDomasGrave
[Left][LoadCeline][FL][LoadHortensia][MR][LoadDomaBoss]
[Left]
So you are (D.F.)? I am Celine,[N]
and my friend is Hortensia.[AN]
[MR]
So, Celine. You want to see[N]
Doma for yourself?[AN]
Well, very well. Who's that[N]
pink thing behind you?[AN]
[FL]
Pink thing?! How don't you[N]
recognise my cuteness?[AN]
As Celine said, my name is[N]
Hortensia![AN]
[MR]
...Cuteness. Sigh... Well,[N]
the details don't matter.[AN]
Keep walking down this way.[N]
You're going to distract[AN]
Alm, you say? Well, I don't[N]
know all the details.[AN]
But you're saying that this[N]
"Divine One" will help us[AN]
become more prominent?[N]
What do we do in exchange?[AN]
[Left]
Well, our interests are for[N]
Alm to not destroy your group.[AN]
We'll give you financial aid[N]
and help grow your influence.[AN]
And in exchange, you help us[N]
whenever and wherever it is[AN]
necessary. I have word that...[N]
let's say a target of ours[AN]
has recently arrived on Valencia.[N]
The Divine One simply must[AN]
recapture him. She'll stop at[N]
nothing. Nothing at all.[AN]
[MR]
You two, we've arrived. You[N]
wanted to see Doma.[AN]
[FL]
I don't see anything here.[N]
Just a whole lot of swamp.[AN]
And... are those eyeballs[N]
moving around? Ew![AN]
[Left]
Hortensia, look over there.[N]
It looks like a giant corpse.[AN]
Is that giant corpse Doma?[N]
Has he been dead all along?[AN]
[MR]
Yes, exactly. Alm killed him.[N]
The War Father is no more.[AN]
If we could, we would of course[N]
attempt to revive him.[AN]
But the magic of the revival[N]
fountains does not suffice.[AN]
Even then, his mind was starting[N]
to slip somewhat...[AN]
[FL]
He's dead? Aw... Did we waste[N]
our time down here?[AN]
[Left]
No, this was worthwhile. We gained[N]
some useful knowledge.[AN]
This cavern is crawling with the[N]
Corrupted. This man reminds me[AN]
far too much of Sombron and his[N]
followers. But, he's useful.[AN]
[FL]
Useful? What do you mean, Celine?[N]
What use does he have?[AN]
[Left]
Let me put it like this. Do[N]
you know anyone a bit more...[AN]
palatable, Hortensia? If I did,[N]
I'd be dealing with them.[AN]
[FL]
I get your point. Well, we're[N]
here. So, let's hear the man[AN]
out. I do see the resemblance[N]
to Dad's advisors, though...[AN]
[MR]
What are you two muttering[N]
about? Anyway, influence for[AN]
cash sounds like a good deal.[N]
So, how about we agree?[AN]
[Left]
I suppose we should. It is a shame[N]
Doma is dead: the Divine One[AN]
would much prefer him alive.[N]
But we still share common ground.[AN]
[FL]
Hey Celine, cheer up a bit. We[N]
found some help for the Divine[AN]
One's mission here. That's a[N]
good thing, is it not?[AN]
[Left]
Yes, Hortensia. Let's talk outside.[N]
(D.F.), it's a pleasure.[AN]
[MR]
Yes. Celine, Hortensia, may[N]
Doma's blessings be upon you.[AN][Clear]
[Left]
Phew, he's gone. Hortensia,[N]
as soon as we see daylight[AN]
we're having a nice cup of[N]
tea. I... need to relax.[AN]
I'm glad to have a friend[N]
like you right now.[A][X]
