A sense of unease spreads across Lycia.[N]
News of the raid was quick to circulate.[AN]
War against Etruria was troubling enough:[N]
with constant rumours of dissent against[AN]

## Ch9OpeningLilinaBarth
[ML][LoadLilina][MR][LoadBarth]
[ML]
General Barth, is it true that[N]
(name) has attacked our land?[AN]
[MR]
Reports from our scouts suggest[N]
as much, your majesty.[AN]
Marquess Pherae and Mr. Lowell[N]
engaged the raid in combat.[AN]
It appears they were victorious.[N]
Your majesty, what do you think[AN]
about Mr. Lowell? I find his sudden[N]
appearance highly suspicious.[AN]
[ML]
I cannot rule anything out, of course.[N]
But if he and his friends are willing[AN]
to assist in our battles, I am inclined[N]
to consider them trustworthy.[AN]
[MR]
You don't believe Mr. Lowell is[N]
associated with Alfonse?[AN]
[ML]
No. I would like to know more about[N]
the state of Akaneia, though.[AN]
I think Marth knows more than he lets[N]
on. That he's more important than[AN]
he lets on. I hope Marquess Pherae[N]
returns soon. We have much to discuss.[AN]
[MR]
Very well. I must return to guard[N]
duty. Be well, your majesty.[A][X]

## Ch9OpeningLilinaMeeting
[Left][LoadLilina][Right][LoadMarth][FR][LoadEliwood]
[Left]
Marquess Pherae, Mr. Lowell.[N]
Welcome back. I have heard[AN]
of the battle at the border.[N]
This is deeply troubling.[AN]
[FR]
Yes, it is. We reached the border[N]
fortress when Lord (name) launched[AN]
an attack. It was far larger than[N]
his typical border raids.[AN]
I would be inclined to believe that[N]
war with the colonial Etrurian[AN]
faction is imminent. We crossed the[N]
border briefly to defeat their[AN]
commander, which may be used as an[N]
excuse to declare war. We must[AN]
bolster security across Lycia[N]
urgently.[AN]
[Left]
Indeed. We must summon the levies.[N]
We must have the knights of every[AN]
march at the ready at every border.[N]
Mobilisation is looking inevitable.[AN]
Now, Mr. Lowell, I've been wanting[N]
to speak with you again.[AN]
I have a lot of questions that I[N]
want you to answer.[AN]
[Right]
Of course. I'll answer[N]
what I can.[AN]
[Left]
Tell me what position you hold in[N]
the Akaneian Empire.[A]
[Right]
I... believe that saying I was the[N]
Emperor of Akaneia is accurate.[AN]
I unified the continent about five[N]
years ago, but I got abducted[AN]
slightly over two years ago now.[N]
In my absence, civil war broke[AN]
out. I managed to escape, but I[N]
returned to an unrecognisable[AN]
Akaneia. A hostile army officer,[N]
his name is Kris, defeated my[AN]
brother-in-law, Marich, soon[N]
after my return and seized the[AN]
throne. He declared Sheeda a[N]
traitor and claimed I married[AN]
Alear, from the Kingdom of Lythos.[N]
She had a hand in my abduction.[AN]
[FR]
Alear... Chiki mentioned her when[N]
we defeated the colonial army's[AN]
commander. She was also a victim[N]
of abduction before being saved[AN]
by Marth. It's not isolated to[N]
a single case, then.[A]
[Left]
So, should I call you the Emperor[N]
of Akaneia instead? I apologise[AN]
for any offence I may have caused.[A]
[Right]
It's fine. I didn't tell you and[N]
Elibe is on the other side of[AN]
the world from Akaneia. How could[N]
you have known? I have been trying[AN]
to keep it quiet, but we shouldn't[N]
keep secrets if we're allies.[A]
[Left]
Very well, then. I'd quite like it[N]
if we could be allies.[AN]
Could you tell me more about Alear?[N]
Is she helping the colonials?[AN]
[Right]
Alear... she's the queen of Lythos.[N]
Lythos is hundreds of miles distant[AN]
from Akaneia, and isn't usually[N]
visible on maps. Lythos is at the[AN]
centre of the land of Elyos, a small[N]
archipelago. She claims to be a[AN]
Divine Dragon and is worshipped as[N]
a god, the "Divine One".[AN]
They also hold the "Emblems" in high[N]
regard. As best as I can tell, they[AN]
are important historical figures.[AN]
[Left]
Important historical figures? From[N]
what parts of the world?[AN]
[Right]
The entire world. Some are ancient,[N]
some contemporary, and some are[AN]
allegedly from the future. Legends[N]
speak of the Twelve Emblems, but[AN]
that number may soon expand. They[N]
are mostly some form of spirit, but[AN]
I was Alear's favourite Emblem.[N]
And I'm not a spirit.[AN]
[Left]
Marth, just who are the Twelve Emblems?[N]
And how many are spirits?[AN]
[Right]
The Emblems rarely converse between[N]
each other, so I don't know who's[AN]
a spirit and who is alive. I do[N]
know their names, though.[AN]
Myself, Celica, Sigurd, Leaf, Roy,[N]
Lyn, Eirika, Ike, Micaiah,[AN]
Lucina, Corrin, and Byleth...[N]
I suspect Alear wanted to turn[AN]
Chiki into an Emblem too, just[N]
before that failed wedding...[A]
[FR]
Roy... Lyn... I haven't seen her[N]
in years. Did she disappear from[AN]
the plains of Sacae? Or is that[N]
spirit seperate from Lyn herself?[A]
[Right]
Those details, I'm afraid I don't[N]
actually know.[AN]
[Left]
Roy... kidnapped? Turned into an[N]
Emblem? How did you get out?[AN]
[Right]
Alear's... clingy. You can "engage"[N]
with an Emblem. You also get engaged[AN]
to be married. I don't know how, but[N]
my memory of Sheeda was surpressed.[AN]
I happily went along with Alear until[N]
she inadvertently reminded me of[AN]
Sheeda the night before the wedding.[N]
Once I fully remembered who Sheeda[AN]
is, I broke free from Alear and[N]
fled back home to Akaneia.[AN]
[Left]
So, Roy's probably in Lythos...[N]
Going along with Alear...[AN]
And there's no easy way to get[N]
there to save him.[AN]
[Right]
I doubt Alear will make the same[N]
mistake twice. I remembered[AN]
Sheeda, and then I caught Chiki[N]
before she could be taken to[AN]
Lythos. Even if we reach Roy,[N]
who's to say he remembers you?[AN]
[Left]
We have to find Roy. Does Alear[N]
have any allies?[AN]
[Right]
She backed Kris in the Akaneian[N]
civil war. The commander we[AN]
defeated at the Etrurian border[N]
appeared Elyosian: I'd say the[AN]
colonials have Lythian backing.[N]
She also knows Alfonse.[AN]
[Left]
Stop there. She knows Alfonse?[N]
I've seen him here in Ostia![AN]
He gave me a suspicious contract,[N]
saying he knew where Roy is.[AN]
[Right]
Typical Alfonse. You were right[N]
not to sign it. Nothing good[AN]
comes out of those contracts.[N]
You could have enslaved yourself.[A]
[Left]
Alfonse has allies... Marth, I[N]
need you to come with me.[AN]
Bern, like Etruria, is divided.[N]
I must pay Queen Guinevere a[AN]
visit. If she's overthrown,[N]
or abducted, Lycia's finished.[A]
[FR]
I'll come too. We can travel[N]
through Pherae on the way.[AN]
It's over a month's ride to[N]
Bern Keep, but Ostia's defence[AN]
is strong. It should withstand[N]
a siege in our absence.[AN]
[Left]
General Barth![AN]
[FL][LoadBarth][Left]
You are in charge of Ostia while[N]
I'm visiting Bern. If I don't[AN]
return within two months, then[N]
you should expect the worst.[AN]
[FL]
Understood. What will the[N]
password be?[AN]
[Left]
It's ... ... ...[A]
[FL]
Understood.[A]
[Right]
So long as Sheeda and Chiki can[N]
accompany me, I'll happily[AN]
join you, Queen Lilina. We're[N]
in this war together.[A]
[Left]
That makes me happy. Very well,[N]
we must be off.[A][X]

## Ch9OpeningPheraeIntro

Home. I can only hope Roy will come[N]
home soon, and Elibe stays safe.[A][X]

## Ch9OpeningPherae
[Right][LoadLilina][FR][LoadEliwood][ML][LoadMerlinus]
Lord Eliwood! Your majesty![N]
It is good to see you again.[AN]
What brings you here to Pherae[N]
in these troubling times?[AN]
[Right]
I'm travelling to Bern. I must not[N]
allow Queen Guinevere to fall.[AN]
Also, Alfonse is not alone. Be on[N]
your guard. He has allies from[AN]
far beyond Elibe. His capabilities[N]
are unpredictable.[AN]
[ML]
Very well, your majesty. I will[N]
prepare Pherae's defences as[AN]
best I can. We will be prepared[N]
for any attack from Bern.[AN]
[Right]
Merlinus, if Alfonse appears, do[N]
not sign anything. Do not trust[AN]
any peace offerings he may make.[N]
No matter how good it sounds.[AN]
[ML]
Your majesty, this is most unlike[N]
you. Why do you find Alfonse so[AN]
suspicious, anyway? He offered to[N]
take you to Roy, but you declined![AN]
If he extended that offer to me,[N]
I'd have gladly taken it.[AN]
[Right]
At the time, it sounded too good to[N]
be true. Now, I believe Alfonse[AN]
is in league with our enemies.[N]
The Etrurian colonial faction...[AN]
[ML]
Who did you find that out from?[N]
Everything is moving so fast.[AN]
[FR]
Our sources are also foreign to[N]
Elibe, but Marth and his friends[AN]
actually fought for Lycia's defence.[N]
I trust him and his words.[AN]
[ML]
Very well, Lord Eliwood. Safe travels,[N]
and be careful while you're in Bern.[A][X]

## Ch9OpeningApproachingBernKeep
[FL][LoadEliwood][Left][LoadLilina][Right][LoadMarth][FR][LoadSheeda]
[FL]
Let's rest here for a moment. Bern[N]
Keep isn't far from here, but it's[AN]
a long climb up this mountain.[N]
It's so tense... anything could happen.[AN]
[Right]
These mountain peaks are so tall.[N]
I can't see anything ahead.[AN]
[FL]
Indeed. Bern know this, and it's no[N]
wonder they've set their capital[AN]
up at the summit. I've fought in[N]
a battle here before. I'd rather[AN]
not get involved in a second one,[N]
but it's best to be prepared.[A]
[Left]
Quiet. I think I see dragon knights[N]
in the sky above us. Either they're[AN]
loyal to Guinevere and will help,[N]
or we're about to get ambushed.[A]
[FR]
I'll go take a look.[A][X]

## Ch9OpeningRebellion
[ML][LoadRogueBernBoss][MR][LoadDiamant]
//the leader of the rebels
[ML]
Our scouts have spotted an[N]
unknown party approaching[AN]
Bern Keep from the south.[N]
Lycia is distracted with[AN]
(Etrurian)'s raids. This is[N]
the time to strike Lycia![AN]
[MR]
Yes. (name), I'm sure you've[N]
heard of the Lycian queen's[AN]
current leave of absence.[N]
I wouldn't be surprised if[AN]
Lilina was travelling to[N]
meet Guinevere to discuss[AN]
things face to face. This[N]
would be troubling.[AN]
[ML]
Troubling is an understatement.[N]
The mighty Kingdom of Bern,[AN]
reduced to a puppet of Lycia.[N]
Roy may be gone, but that[AN]
usurper Guinevere is happy to[N]
continue serving Lilina.[AN]
I've got more scouts going in[N]
for a closer look. If Lilina[AN]
really is travelling in this[N]
convoy, then today's my lucky[AN]
day. I can destroy Lycia with[N]
a single blow. Yes... yes![AN]
[FL][LoadFace][0x6B][0x01]
//red soldier
Sir (name), a detailed report.[N]
It appears the convoy does[AN]
contain the Queen of Lycia.[N]
Marquess Pherae is also present.[AN]
There are also some unfamiliar[N]
people at the front of the convoy.[AN]
[ML]
Any descriptions?[A]
[FL]
There's a young girl with green[N]
hair, wearing pink. Doesn't[AN]
appear to be dangerous in any[N]
way whatsoever.[AN]
There's also a man, mid-twenties.[N]
Blue hair, blue clothing.[A]
[MR]
Green and pink? All-blue? It...[N]
no, that's impossible.[AN]
[FL]
We would have investigated[N]
further but a pegasus knight[AN]
noticed our presence. She was[N]
by herself, which is unusual.[AN]
Blue hair, red skirt, same[N]
age as the blue man.[AN]
[MR]
That's impossible. Veyle said[N]
they were all shipwrecked.[AN]
[ML]
"Veyle", Diamant? Who's that?[N]
Anything to that "Divine One"?[AN]
[MR]
She's... related to the Divine[N]
One, who trusts her implicitly.[AN]
But if she's wrong... If Marth[N]
truly is alive... what happened?[AN]
(name), I have to go. Here's[N]
your latest payment.[AN]
[ML]
Haha... That's fine by me. We both[N]
stand to profit from Lilina's fall.[AN]
Bern's position will be secure, and[N]
Lythos will have a secure Emblem.[AN]
[MR]
Yes, yes. May your rebellion succeed,[N]
and long live the Divine One.[A][Clear]
[ML]
Hmph. I like his money, but I've no[N]
idea what Diamant and that "Divine[AN]
One" really want. Do they want to[N]
rule Lycia? I could think all day.[AN]
But now is the time for action. All[N]
men, attack the southern convoy![A][X]

Your majesty, (name)'s unit has[N]
attacked a convoy approaching[AN]

What are your orders?[AN]
[MR]
We defend the castle. Do you have[N]
any idea who's in that convoy?[AN]
[ML]
The Queen of Lycia and the Marquess[N]
of Pherae, your majesty.[A]
[MR]
Queen Lilina? Marquess Eliwood?[N]
What are they doing here?[AN]
[ML]
I assume they come in peace, but[N]
(name) provoking a fight means[AN]
they will attempt to defend[N]
themselves. Your orders?[A]
[MR]
Well, Lilina's Lycia is our ally.[N]
Attacking her without cause will[AN]
only serve to provoke a pointless[N]
war. And (name) has been growing[AN]
ever more rebellious. I fear we[N]
may be dragged into conflict with[AN]
Lycia, whether we want it or not.[N]
Let Lilina's forces reach Bern[AN]
Keep. Do not allow (name) to take[N]
Bern Keep. His line of thinking[AN]
has caused Bern nothing but problems.[N]
Rebellion cannot be tolerated.[A]
[ML]
Yes, your majesty![A][X]

## Ch9House1
[ML][LoadFace][0x60][0x1][MR][LoadCurrent]
//random civilian
[ML]
So, (name)'s finally made his move.[N]
We would have defeated Lycia if[AN]
it weren't for that usurper Guinevere[N]
stealing the Fire Emblem and giving[AN]
it to Roy. Without that, he'd never[N]
have been able to use the Sword of[AN]
Seals against King Zephiel. If General[N]
Narshen stuck around Araphen for a[AN]
small while longer, Roy may never have[N]
managed to topple King Zephiel.[AN]
Oh, there's no point in fantasising.[N]
I just want (name) to take Lycia[AN]
down a peg, because Guinevere sure[N]
isn't going to anger them![A][X]

## Ch9House2
[ML][LoadFace][0x60][0x1][MR][LoadCurrent]
//random civilian
[ML]
(name) fought for Bern during the[N]
Disturbance, but wasn't in the[AN]
front lines. Our defeat in Ostia[N]
has given him a sharp distaste[AN]
for anything and everyone to do[N]
with Lycia. He's not alone.[AN]
I wouldn't say it's a majority,[N]
but if you gathered ten Bernese,[AN]
maybe three or four of them are[N]
angry at Roy's army for defeating[AN]
King Zephiel and installing Queen[N]
Guinevere as a puppet queen.[AN]
But Zephiel dying automatically[N]
meant Guinevere ascending: he[AN]
never had any children or lover.[N]
But (name's) rebels don't care.[A][X]

## Ch9Village
[ML][LoadFace][0x60][0x1][MR][LoadCurrent]
//random civilian
[ML]
That foolish (name) just had to pick[N]
a fight with you, didn't he?[AN]
Queen Guinevere wants nothing[N]
more than peace in Elibe, but[AN]
his stupid petty grudges are[N]
going to cause Lycia to invade[AN]
us again. The hatchet needs to[N]
be buried, and we all need to[AN]
work together for the sake of[N]
a better Elibe. You're with[AN]
the Lycian convoy making its[N]
way up to Bern Keep, aren't[AN]
you? Here, take this. It's not[N]
doing me any good. If (name)[AN]

he gets for stupid warmongering.[A][X]

Queen Lilina, Marquess Eliwood. I am[N]
glad to see you in good health.[AN]
May I ask you the purpose of your[N]
visit to Bern Keep today?[A]
[Right]
The pleasure is mine, Queen Guinevere.[N]
As I'm sure you know, Elibe is growing[AN]
ever more unstable recently. I came[N]
to ensure Bern is stable and to warn[AN]
you of some concerning information I[N]
have come to learn of recently.[AN]
[Left]
While I appreciate your concern, I[N]
must ask: why did you leave Lycia?[AN]
You of all people must know the damage[N]
absentee leadership causes a kingdom.[AN]
Lycia's never been a bastion of stability.[N]
What stops, say, Laus from rebelling?[AN]
[Right]
Nothing, but I did leave trusted men[N]
behind in order to keep the peace.[AN]
But ultimately, the stability of Bern[N]
is more important for Elibe.[AN]
Nobody in Lycia seriously wants to[N]
provoke a war with anyone.[AN]
But we had to fight a rogue unit of[N]
Bern's army on our way to visit you.[AN]
[Left]
It's true... Bern is deeply divided.[N]
I do appreciate your help, Queen[AN]
Lilina. Many are dissatisfied with[N]
my reign. They seek a return to my[AN]
brother's time. But we both know[N]
that my brother ultimately wanted[AN]
to return Elibe to the dragons.[N]
Zephiel had to be stopped. Even if[AN]
he was my brother, the peace of the[N]
world is more important than him.[AN]
Now, you say you have information[N]
