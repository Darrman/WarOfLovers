## Ch16WorldMap
Marth stands at the front gate of Sofia[N]
Castle. The Kingdom of Sofia was founded[AN]
slightly over 200 years ago, though Mila[N]
held influence in the south long before.[AN]
Some sources suggest Doma and Mila were[N]
sibling Divine Dragons, exiled from Akaneia[AN]
by Narga during the Golden Age of Dragons.[AN]
These sources also attribute Thebes's fall[N]
to Doma. But not everybody agrees with this.[AN]
Some would instead argue they were truly[N]
gods, with nothing draconic about them.[AN]
If that's true, then they likely inhabited[N]
Valencia since time immemorial.[AN]
Regardless of the truth, they are now dead.[N]
Neither of Valencia's gods has any sway now,[AN]
and a foreign army is about to destroy a[N]
preciously rare symbol of a united Valencia.[AN]
Alm may regret his actions, but the wheels[N]
of time cannot be turned back.[AN]
He and "Celica" - Celine - appeared to have[N]
condemned Valencia to a crushing defeat.[AN]
Marth was not interested in destroying the[N]
continent. But could anyone convince Alm?[AN]
Valencia's only hope lay in cutting the[N]
Lythian strings tying Alm in knots...[A][X]

## Ch16OpeningGoodJobCeline
//I want Alear to scare Celine at some point, but how does she get into Sofia
//Castle at this point? Maybe move this scene somewhere else?
[ML][LoadAlear][MR][LoadCeline]
[ML]
It's been a while, hasn't it, Celine?[N]
I must say, you've been very efficient[AN]
at causing Valencia to implode.[N]
You sabotage some infrastructure,[AN]
do a deal with the Doma Faithful,[N]
and cause Alm to launch a doomed war![AN]
I didn't interfere, but I did hear the[N]
whole speech. Don't worry, "Celica".[AN]
I won't tell anyone our secret.[N]
Just keep doing what you're doing.[AN]
[MR]
How much of this is really necessary?[N]
Deceiving Alm is hard enough.[AN]
But bringing defeated cults back from[N]
the grave? Divine One, the Doma[AN]
Faithful are on par with Sombron![N]
Are you comfortable with helping them?[AN]
[ML]
We both know if Alm isn't dealt with,[N]
he could turn Emblem Celica against us.[AN]
There's no second Valencian ring, and[N]
he'd be a decent candidate for that...[AN]
//Conditional for number of rings lost
We've already lost a third of the[N]
original twelve Emblem Rings.[AN]
Doma isn't Sombron. He's one of the[N]
Dark Emblems. Unfortunately, we're[AN]
too late to find him alive...[N]
Why is death such an issue?[AN]
[MR]
Let me at least say this. Alm is fooled,[N]
but his inner circle are largely not.[AN]
I do look like Celica. But I'm not her.[N]
I want peace at any cost.[AN]
She wants peace, and fighting is a[N]
last resort. The others are noticing.[AN]
[ML]
Remember, you have the Ring of the[N]
Caring Princess on - that's what's[AN]
maintaining the illusion. Lose that[N]
ring, and Alm will have your head![AN]
//Now, Celine, stop concerning yourself[N]
//about what the Valencians think.[AN]
//Frame them for treason as you've pinned[N]
//this war on Marth.[AN]
//I do regret you not exempting Kris[N]
//from the declaration. He's an ally.[AN]
Now, Celine, there has to be a way[N]
to outsmart Alm's advisors here.[AN]
Perhaps it's possible to frame up[N]
a particularly malcontent one?[AN]
You did pin this whole war on Marth,[N]
after all. Sigh... Oh, Marth...[AN]
I'd have preferred it if Alm didn't[N]
declare on Kris. We are allies.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]
[ML]
That's forgiveable, really. Just go[N]
after Kain if you win, or return to[AN]
Firene if you don't. Just make sure[N]
Alm isn't a problem when you're done![AN]
[MR]
Of... of course, Divine One.[N]
May we save all Twelve Emblems.[AN]
[ML][Clear]
[MR]
...What am I doing?[N]
I am the Queen of Firene.[AN]
What does destroying Valencia[N]
have to do with Firene's[AN]
prosperity? But if I betray[N]
the Divine-- Alear...[AN]
Alfred is dead. I have no heir.[N]
I can't die here. I must live.[AN]
I must win. Whatever the cost.[N]
For the sake of Firene.[A][X]

## Ch16OpeningHowToStopAlm
[Left][LoadMarth][Right][LoadSheeda]
Marth, how are we going to convince[N]
Alm to stop the fighting?[AN]
[Left]
Nothing we say is going to stop[N]
him. We're just a conquering[AN]
army to him. We need one of Alm's[N]
own subjects to speak to him.[AN]
[Right]
And "Celica"?[A]
[Left]
Well... what is there to do?[N]
She's Alear's proxy in Valencia.[AN]
//Too obvious?
It would take a miracle for us[N]
to persuade her...[AN][X]

## Ch16AfterPrepEveryoneTakesPosition
[Left][LoadAlm][Right][LoadRedCeline]
Everyone else is in position.[N]
Either we defend Sofia Castle,[AN]
or we die trying. We don't have[N]
any other choice.[AN]
[Left]
No, we don't. Grey is guarding[N]
the throne room. Mycen is at[AN]
the top of the stairs, and[N]
we have the balcony blocked.[AN]
If they break in here, we fight[N]
to our last breath.[AN]
[Right]
I have one last thing to take[N]
care of. I'll be with you[AN]
then, Alm. I promise I shall[N]
not be long. Please stay safe.[AN][X]

## Ch16OpeningDoma
//Put this before Celine and Alear?
[Left][LoadDomaBoss][Right][LoadCeline]
Hello again, Pilate. Remember our[N]
deal? Lythos gives you influence,[AN]
you give us assistance. It's time[N]
you held up your end of the deal.[AN]
[Left]
Ah yes. Your "Divine One" is very[N]
generous. Money has swelled our[AN]
coffers, and many are joining us.[N]
//Will Alm be eliminated today?[AN]
Will we prevail in today's battle?[AN]
[Right]
...Of course.[A]
[Left]
Oddly hesitant, aren't you? No matter.[N]
You've removed Celica for us, and she[AN]
did more damage to our order altogether.[N]
May Doma's blessings be upon you, Celine.[AN]
[Right]
Why... thank you. Now, I must fight[N]
the Akaneians: they are also a threat.[AN]
[Left]
Well, before you go, a friend of yours[N]
is here. She wants to see you.[AN]
[Right]
A friend? Who could that be?[N]
Is the Divine One here?[AN]
[Left]
She didn't give a name. Probably one[N]
of your Firenese buddies. Blue and[AN]
red hair: as if the two-tone pink[N]
girl wasn't odd enough. Go on.[AN]
[Right]
Remember: keep up your end of the[N]
bargain, or you shall regret it.[AN]
[Clear]
[Left]
Hmph... The money's good, but[N]
she's got that stench of...[AN]
I don't know. That woman... I[N]
don't trust her one little bit.[AN]
But she's still supplying us.[N]

[ML][LoadMarth][MR][LoadRedCeline]
So, it's true. As King Diamant said,[N]
you survived that shipwreck.[AN]
Louis died in that wreck, you know.[N]
I have no reason to lie to you,[AN]
Emblem Marth. I am Celine, Queen of[N]
Firene. I simply must win today.[AN]
[ML]
Queen? I swear on my honour, I did[N]
not kill Alfred.[AN]
[MR]
That wasn't your fault. He over-[N]
worked himself, all for Alear...[AN]
[ML]
Did you just say "Alear"?[A]
[MR]
The Divine One, rather. And for[N]
her sake... For Firene's sake...[AN]
I must defeat you. Your war is[N]
disturbing the world's peace.[AN]
The Divine One must collect all[N]
Twelve Emblems. Otherwise...[AN]
[ML]
Celine, do you even have any idea[N]
what miracle Alear wants to cause?[AN]
[MR]
I... I don't, beyond her just[N]
being happy to have them back.[AN]
[ML]
How selfish. You've plunged Valencia[N]
into utter chaos for the sake of[AN]
Alear's fantasy. Akaneia, Elibe,[N]
Valencia... Does this have any end?[AN]
[MR]
...I have no choice. Say I betrayed[N]
Alear. What of Firene? Of Mother?[AN]
She abdicated to Alfred, and isn't[N]
taking his death well as is.[AN]
If I die, Firene is finished![N]
Brodia's already crumbling after[AN]
you killed Diamant and Alcryst.[N]
I cannot allow Firene to follow![A]
[ML]
...I see. Very well. This talk is[N]
over. This war ends today. If you[AN]
obstruct the peace proceedings,[N]
what more needs to be said?[AN]
[MR]
...Nothing. Firene, Valencia, or[N]
Akaneia: at least one will fall.[A][X]

## Ch16WarpRagnarokWarning
[MR][LoadRedCeline]
I should be able to warp[N]
again soon. I think I can[AN]
keep up this pace for a[N]
while. The flames of[AN]
Ragnarok will burn bright[N]
today. Too bright...[A][X]

## Ch16GreyTurnsGreen
[ML][LoadClaire][MR][LoadGrey]
Claire! You're okay! And you're[N]
fighting with Akaneia?[AN]
[ML]
Grey, listen. Marth does not want[N]
a war. Celica has not come back.[AN]
Alm is being manipulated by an[N]
impostor. He needs to see sense.[AN]
[MR]
Look, Alm's been my friend for[N]
as long as I can remember.[AN]
I don't wanna be the guy to[N]
burst his bubble, ya know?[AN]
[ML]
Is Alm's bubble worth the end of[N]
everything Valencia holds dear?[AN]
Marth's army is trying to avoid[N]
causing casualties. He'd listen[AN]
to you, surely. Maybe not me,[N]
but he'd listen to you.[AN]
[MR]
I dunno, Celica's got him wrapped[N]
around her little finger...[AN]
But maybe General Mycen could[N]
get through to him. He's against[AN]
this whole war. Together... We[N]
have to get rid of "Celica".[AN]
That goes without saying. I'll[N]
help you get rid of her.[AN]
[ML]
If Marth is correct, her true[N]
name is actually Celine...[AN]
And her power is derived from[N]
a ring on her finger.[AN]
[MR]
Got it. Well, let's go. This[N]
Celine will regret ever trying[AN]
to destroy Valencia.[A][X]

## Ch16GreyPersuadesMycen
[ML][LoadGrey][MR][LoadMycen]
[ML]
General Mycen, the Akaneian forces[N]
are coming this way. They want to[AN]
negotiate with Emperor Alm directly.[N]
Please, let us through.[AN]
[MR]
...Yes. Fighting to the end is[N]
simply just a waste of life.[AN]
I may not have long left, but[N]
I cannot allow Alm to throw[AN]
his life away. We must persuade[N]
him to cease this folly.[AN]
And then see just what is wrong[N]
with Celica...[AN]
[ML]
Claire tells me she's a fake.[N]
Someone else replaced her.[AN]
[MR]
...I knew it. She always seemed[N]
off to me. We must end this.[A][X]

//Louis, Chloe; Chloe updated Louis off-screen

Huff... Queen Celine... It's[N]
been so long. Valencia...[AN]
What are you doing? I need to[N]
talk to you. It's important.[AN]
[FR]
Honestly, I can't believe you're[N]
alive. It really does feel like[AN]
a fairy tale right now. Should[N]
we really interrupt her majesty?[AN]
[Right]
Chloe, I must discuss things.[N]
I've been watching and observing[AN]
her actions after the shipwreck.[N]
Keep close to me.[AN]
[FR]
Let's just say I've not been on[N]
my best behaviour in Valencia,[AN]
and I'd really rather not be[N]
seen by Valencian forces...[AN]
[Right]
The Akaneians just gave you[N]
Venomous and let you go.[AN]
And they wanted nothing in[N]
return. It fascinates me.[AN]
[FR]
It baffles me. Just why was[N]
he so kind to me?[AN]
I doubt he hesitated when he[N]
was fighting other Elyosians.[AN]
[Right]
I'll explain when we reach[N]
Celine. Don't pick any fights![A][X]

## Ch16CelineWavers
[ML][LoadRedCeline][Right][LoadLouis][FR][LoadChloe]
//Celine, Louis, Chloe
[Right]
Your majesty![A]
[ML]
...Are my eyes playing tricks on me?[N]
Is Akaneia returning the favour[AN]
I've inflicted upon Valencia?[N]
You cannot be Louis. He drowned.[AN]
[Right]
Officially, I have. Veyle's fleet[N]
recovered many objects and bodies.[AN]
But in truth, I washed up on shore.[N]
I couldn't find any other survivors,[AN]
so I decided to make my way to safety.[N]
It was a long, arduous journey.[AN]
[FR]
Why didn't you signal for help?[N]
Veyle would have rescued you.[AN]
[Right]
//No radar to fly under, no electricity grid to go off...
Disappearing for a time suited me[N]
fine, Chloe. Marth's forces[AN]
could well have charged onto my[N]
boat and killed me. But they didn't.[AN]
Why? There was no hesitation when[N]
fighting Boucheron or Clanne.[AN]
[ML]
They were directly occupying Talis.[N]
That's where Sheeda is from...[AN]
[Right]
I made sure to avoid any contact[N]
with any militant group on Akaneia.[AN]
I knew King Alfred had been working on[N]
Valencia, so I decided to head here.[AN]
I made it a few weeks before Marth.[N]
Then I simply started observing.[AN]
[ML]
...I see. Well, Louis? What did[N]
you observe, exactly?[AN]
[Right]
I arrived just before Celica was[N]
abducted. Valencia struck me as[AN]
a peaceful place. I saw her in[N]
person at a gathering, though[AN]
I didn't talk to her. Then she[N]
disappeared. The peace shattered.[AN]
Nobody had any idea who did it.[N]
I knew it was on the Divine One's[AN]
orders, but I kept quiet. She[N]
likes the chaos, does she not?[AN]
[ML]
Just look at Akaneia and Elibe:[N]
Elyosians all breaking them.[AN]
[FR]
Our orders were clear: remove any[N]
threat to Emblem Celica.[AN]
We all saw what happened with Marth.[N]
Most importantly, Alm.[AN]
[ML]
It feels like the Divine One has[N]
been getting... angrier lately.[AN]
Less willing to deal with anyone[N]
who aggrevates her.[AN]
[Right]
Everyone blamed everyone for a time.[N]
Then the Elibian ship arrived.[AN]
There was a battle at the border[N]
floodgate, which was soon sabotaged.[AN]
[ML]
Alm said at one point the old border[N]
had a flooding problem. Damaging the[AN]
floodgate would certainly destablise[N]
Valencia, so I had Chloe sabotage it.[AN]
[Right]
Officially the faiths of Doma and[N]
Mila were merged, but when I[AN]
attended a communal service one day,[N]
I mostly saw Mila's faithful.[AN]
The imperial merger of the religions[N]
was a failure, and a renegade[AN]
faction of the Doma Faithful started[N]
to gain influence again.[AN]
[ML]
They are the primary malcontents.[N]
Alfred identified them, and[AN]
I kept Alear's money flowing.[N]
They're a repugnant grouping,[AN]
and they summon Corrupted of many[N]
different types to fight.[AN]
How did the Divine One not notice[N]
any? She hates them![AN]
[Right]
Speaking of the Divine One, I saw[N]
her from afar very recently.[AN]
Rumour is spreading about how[N]
Celica isn't showing her face[AN]
and why: that's when I realised.[N]
The replacement plan was chosen.[AN]
[ML]
I do have a passing resemblance to[N]
Emblem Celica while engaged.[AN]
Enough to deceive Alm, but he must[N]
surely be close to the truth.[AN]
I was the one who encouraged him[N]
to declare this war. If I[AN]
got him killed, nobody could snap[N]
Celica out of Alear's control.[AN]
Valencia would be condemned to a[N]
bloody war with the Akaneian[AN]
splinters, and its destruction[N]
would be sure. Whose fault would[AN]
it all be? Mine. What does Firene[N]
gain from Valencia's fall?[AN]
[FR]
Your majesty, what are you saying?[N]
Are you suggesting that the Divine[AN]
One might possibly be... wrong?[N]
That this isn't correct?[AN]
[ML]
Chloe... I have always considered[N]
Alear to be a close friend.[AN]
Ever since the war with Sombron,[N]
I thought her heart was pure.[AN]
As does all of Elyos: she's the[N]
Divine Dragon, our highest god.[AN]
But ever since the Emblems left...[N]
Ever since Alfonse first arrived...[AN]
[Right]
Well, the notion of betraying the[N]
Divine One is... unthinkable.[AN]
But would she have endorsed our[N]
actions were this before Sombron?[AN]
[ML]
...Would she? She certainly would[N]
now. Anything to get the Emblems[AN]
back. But then? She was certainly[N]
kinder, more humble...[AN]
[Right]
It's not too late. Ultimately, the[N]
choice is yours. Continue serving[AN]
the Divine One, or chart your own[N]
course, free of the Divine One.[A][X]

## Ch16CelineWavers2
[ML][LoadRedCeline][Right][LoadLouis][FR][LoadChloe]
...Betray the Divine One?! Louis,[N]
listen to yourself. We can't![AN]
Your majesty, when this battle is[N]
won, let's have a cup of tea and[AN]
Valencia's finest folk food. Our[N]
favourites. It sounds wonderful.[AN]
//Scene too long, cuts off around here
[ML]
Why yes, Chloe. That does sound[N]
wonderful. But for what?[AN]
I burn this empire down for the[N]
sake of a cup of tea?[AN]
I can't stand for that. Surely[N]
there has to be another way.[AN]
Marth has been our enemy, but...[N]
would he talk to me, too?[AN]
[FR]
Another way? What other way?[N]
Fairy tales are usually simple.[AN]
[Right]
But this isn't a fairy tale.[N]
Celine. The choice is yours.[AN]
We can continue as we were,[N]
defeat Akaneia, reclaim Marth,[AN]
and follow your orders, keeping[N]
Firene safe from any threat.[AN]
Or you could follow your heart and[N]
do what you think is right,[AN]
because a peace built on such rotten[N]
moral ground is worthless.[AN]
I have my own opinion, but this[N]
is not my decision to make.[AN]
[FR]
Emblem Marth's betrayed the Divine[N]
One, and has killed many of us.[AN]
But if he can avoid killing, he will.[N]
He's famed for his mercy...[AN]
But are we too far gone in his eyes?[N]
Peace with Valencia is not peace[AN]
with Lythos by any means. And we can't[N]
pull Firene alone out of the war.[AN]
[ML]
Who says we can't? I am the queen,[N]
not the Divine One. All of Elyos[AN]
may move in step with her, but[N]
by right we're sovereign nations.[AN]
But betraying Alear... The thought[N]
of it feels utterly repulsive.[AN]
But... yet... is it morally right?[N]
I can't believe I'm thinking of this.[AN]
[Right]
If betrayal is your choice...[N]
//Throw yourself at Marth's mercy.[AN]
//Alm will surely kill you when he[N]
//learns your deception.[AN]
You could throw yourself at[AN]
Marth's mercy, or Alm's.[N]
Make up for your sabotage of[AN]
Valencia, or join Marth's[N]
war for the sake of the world?[AN]
I will support your decision,[N]

Allow me to recite an anecdote,[N]
to see if this helps you.[AN]
During the War of Darkness, I was[N]
friends with a man named Hardin.[AN]
A fine knight, virtuous and brave.[N]
He freed the slaves of Orleans.[AN]
Even his enemies respected him.[N]
And we got on very well.[AN]
[MR]
What does this have to do[N]
with me, Marth?[AN]
[ML]
Keep listening, Celine. Once we[N]
won the war, Hardin became[AN]
the King of Akaneia, having[N]
married Princess Nina. Sigh...[AN]
But Nina loved another, and[N]
Hardin was heartbroken when he[AN]
learned the truth. Soon his[N]
jealousy twisted him, and[AN]
in my friend's place was a[N]
tyrant, Dark Emperor Hardin.[AN]
[MR]
So... Hardin is Alear...?[N]
You're Nina...?[AN]
[ML]
I wanted to save Hardin. But[N]
when I fought him, he was[AN]
too far gone. The Dark Orb[N]
had consumed him, and I had[AN]
no choice but to strike him[N]
down with my own hand.[AN]
I did not like it. But I had[N]
to kill Hardin. And if any[AN]
of my other friends go the[N]
same way... I won't hesitate.[AN]
[MR]
...and I'm you. I understand.[N]
...Peace, at any cost.[AN]
Emperor Marth... I... know what[N]
I must do in this moment.[AN]
Alear... I'm so, so, sorry.[N]
Please forgive me... Sniff...[AN]
But... this is the right thing[N]
to do. I... sob... surrender![AN]
[LoadCeline][......]
This is the Ring of the Caring[N]
Princess! Marth, take it. Give[AN]
this to Alm, and have him say[N]
these words:[AN]
"Care for us, Emblem of Echoes!"[AN]
After that, do as you see fit.[AN]

Thank you, Celine.[N]
Truly. I accept your surrender.[AN]

her free of any mind control.[N]
It's the only true proof.[AN]

Indeed. One thing does bother me,[N]

Celica's summon chant? She seemed[N]
rather... doubtful at times.[AN]
[ML]
There are two possibilities. Either[N]
she was lying to us, trying to[AN]

Or she started to doubt herself,[AN]

I hope the second option is true.[N]
Was there another way?[AN]

No. Even if Celine questioned[N]

His death is most regrettable.[N]
I do not relish in his demise.[AN]

I'll start with this one.[AN]
"Celica", who are you? Really?[N]
Where are you from? What do you[AN]
stand for? Who do you serve, and[N]
what do they have to gain?[AN]
Why didn't I realise this sooner?[N]
Sigh... It doesn't matter.[AN]
[FR]
Alm, where do I begin... My name is[N]
Celine, and I am the Queen of[AN]
Firene. My brother Alfred was the[N]
king, but... he's no longer with us.[AN]
In practice I served the Divine One,[N]
Alear, and she wants to reunite[AN]
all Twelve Emblems. As for what I[N]
stand for... I don't know anymore.[A]
[ML]
Emblems. What in the world is an[N]
Emblem supposed to be?[AN]
[FR]
On Elyos, there are... let's say ghosts.[N]
Based on people from the whole world.[AN]
Past, present, future... One of them[N]
was based on Celica. Another, Marth.[AN]
And Alear wants to upgrade from these[N]
ghosts to physical beings.[AN]
...I kidnapped the real Celica, Alm.[N]
Right now, she's on the Somniel.[AN]
[ML]
The Somniel... That's all I need to know.[N]
Marth, out of my way! I must save[AN]
Celica, and to do that, her impostor[N]
needs to die right now! She kidnapped[AN]
Celica, and tried to replace her![N]
You vermin... that's high treason![AN]

We're not enemies, though. Not anymore.[N]

So, let us begin negotiations. I[N]
believe I owe you an explanation.[AN]
A few months ago, my army was[N]
located on the continent of Elibe.[AN]
We were waging a war against the[N]
forces of Lythos, on Elyos.[AN]
[Left]
I've heard that name in Akaneian[N]
news, but never outside of it.[AN]
But if you're here, you're not[N]
in Alear's company, are you?[AN]
[Right]
Indeed I am not. She kidnapped me[N]
close to three years ago?[AN]
I certainly didn't marry her,[N]
though it was a close call.[AN]
All of us here have been affected[N]
by Alear's quest for Emblems.[AN]
[FR]
Akaneia fell into a civil war when[N]
Marth was kidnapped. It's still[AN]
ongoing as we speak. Not only[N]
that, but Chiki was kidnapped too.[AN]
[Left]
Stop. I've heard that name. The[N]
impostor told me she was a dangerous[AN]
dragon, akin to Doma. I should ask...[N]
how true is that? Is that a lie?[AN]
[FR]
How about you see for yourself?[N]
I'll bring her in now.[AN]
[Clear][LoadChiki]
Hello! So, you're Alm? Why is everyone[N]
on Valencia so grumpy?[AN]
I feel like it's starting to get to me.[N]
I'm getting grumpy too. I'm fine[AN]
right now, but sometimes it feels like[N]
I just want to destroy everything.[AN]
I don't like that feeling. I wish we[N]
could stop fighting, but we can't.[AN]
[Left]
(So, she really does look like a[N]
young girl. She said it's a disguise.[AN]
She was also disguised herself.[N]
Maybe she'll give an honest answer.)[AN]
So, Chiki. I've heard you're a dragon.[N]
Is that true?[AN]
[FR]
(Um... Marth, what should I say?[N]
Is it safe to mention that?)[AN]
[Left]
(She's hesitating. I don't like that.[N]
I think she is a dragon.[AN]
Gramps, what should I do? She's not a[N]
zombie, at the very least.)[AN]
[FL]
(Your majesty, by all accounts she's[N]
just a harmless girl. She bears no[AN]
resemblance to the dragon zombies.[N]
We shouldn't treat her as one.)[AN]
[Right]
(...It's for the best to be clear.[N]
We shouldn't hide anything from Alm.)[AN]
[FR]
...Yes. I'm one of the Divine Dragons.[N]
That orb you're holding... it's the[AN]
Life Orb. It's part of the Shield of[N]
Seals. Alear broke it a while ago.[AN]
Without it, the dragons all start to[N]
lose their minds...[AN]
I don't want to lose my mind. We need[N]
to find all Five Orbs...[AN]
[Left]
So does that mean the dragon zombies[N]
weren't always mindless beasts?[AN]
It's a strange thing to imagine...[N]
Holding a conversation with a dragon.[AN]
You genuinely seem like a nice person.[N]
Losing your mind would be a shame.[AN]
[Right]
Alm, I have two main objectives in[N]
my war. The first is to stop Alear[AN]
from interfering with the world.[N]
The second is to reassemble the[AN]
Shield of Seals and put a halt to[N]
the dragons' degeneration.[AN][X]

[FL][LoadMycen][Left][LoadAlm][Right][LoadMarth][FR][LoadLilina]
[Left]
Right, so that's your second goal[N]
explained well enough. Your first?[AN]
[FR]
I'll explain this one. I am Lilina,[N]
Queen of Lycia, on Elibe.[AN]
I doubt you've heard of it. It's a[N]
very long way away from Valencia.[AN]
My husband, Roy, was kidnapped by[N]
Alear's forces. My enemies were[AN]
assisted by her soldiers, and[N]
in the end, we lost. What's left[AN]
of my army fled Lycia with Marth.[N]
Why was Roy kidnapped?[AN]
Because he is one of Alear's Emblems.[N]
She will do anything to get them.[AN]
And if that includes leaving continents[N]
in ruins, then so be it.[AN]
We can't stand by and let that happen.[N]
Her forces simply must be stopped.[AN]
[FL]
What are you getting at, your highness?[N]
Are you proposing an alliance?[AN]

Yes! We stand as representatives of[N]

during a peace talk?[AN]

Celine gave it to me: it's[AN]
the ring Celica is attached to.[N]
If you put it on and shout[AN]
"Care for us, Emblem of Echoes!",[N]
it should summon her.[A]

I'm suspicious still, Marth.[N]

Let me try something else, then.[N]
//Does Celica ever tell Alm her real name on-screen?
//It would be pretty stupid if he didn't know though
What is your name? Celica, of[AN]
course. But aside from that.[AN]
[Right]
Anteze? I only used that name for[N]
official purposes on Valencia.[AN]
[Left]
Gramps was right! The impostor just[N]
gave a blank look when he called[AN]
her Anteze. You really are Celica![N]
Let me give you a quick reminder.[AN]
I am your husband, Celica! My name[N]

I should introduce myself.[N]
Properly. My name is Celine.[AN]
By right, I'm the queen of[N]

[Right]
I have no love for war, either.[N]
I've been involved in far too[AN]
many of them recently. But they[N]

Do you have any hobbies? I'm[N]

## Ch16EndingCelineExplainsHerself

What do you mean? How were things[N]
before that happened?[AN]
[FL]
Sheeda, please, hear me out.[N]
I'm going to explain everything.[AN]
[Right]
Take as long as you need.[A]
[FL]
...I think starting with when we[N]
first met is a good place.[AN]
The Divine One fell asleep after[N]
the first war with Sombron,[AN]
and as we of Firene tend to be,[N]
we worship the Divine Dragons.[AN]
Being royalty, I often prayed by[N]
Alear's side during her slumber.[AN]
//Engage being Engage, I don't think they ever specify the details
//If they do, fix this, but I'll just draw a Banutu and Chiki parallel
Sleeping like that... it must have[N]
been bitterly lonely.[AN]
I prayed she'd wake up one day.[N]
And then, she did.[AN]
The legends of the Emblems were[N]
true. And the Divine One was[AN]
surprisingly pleasant. We became[N]
fast friends during the war.[AN]
[Right]
You and Alear, friends? Not just[N]
a master whose orders are law?[AN]
[FL]
I'll spare you the finer details[N]
of the second war with Sombron.[AN]
But the important part is that[N]
when we killed him, the Emblems[AN]
all disappeared from their rings.[N]
They used up all of their energy[AN]
resurrecting Alear... the miracle.[N]
We all looked to a bright future.[AN]
But Alear never quite accepted[N]
that the Emblems vanished.[AN]
That Marth vanished, specifically.[N]
She woke up with his ring.[AN]
[Right]
So was your Marth the first person[N]
Alear saw when she woke up?[AN]
And how does this relate to her[N]
pursuit of my Marth?[AN]
[FL]
//She gets the first line
That would be Framme, but she and[N]
Emblem Marth were very close.[AN]
After he disappeared, she would[N]
try to summon him again.[AN]
She was formally crowned Queen of[N]
Lythos, and we had many great[AN]
conversations, but Marth kept[N]
coming back up. All of them,[AN]
really. But Marth especially.[N]
She couldn't accept his loss.[AN]
[Right]
//Sheeda catches the Alear = Sombron parallel now, but Celine needs to figure
//it out for herself
I'm getting an idea of what's[N]
going on. Celine, a question.[AN]
You mention the name "Sombron".[N]
Who was this person?[A]
[FL]
He was the Dark Dragon. His goal[N]
was to reunite with the Emblem[AN]
of Foundations, or the Zero Emblem.[N]
We don't know who this is.[AN]
[Right]
I understand now. Carry on.[A]
[FL]
The Divine One sank into a deep[N]
depression as time passed.[AN]
I tried to cheer her up as best[N]
as I could. All of us did.[AN]
But nothing would work. Alear was[N]
desperate to see Marth again.[AN]
And then, that fateful day...[N]
He arrived in Lythos.[AN]
[Right]
And who would "he" be?[A]
[FL]
"He" would be Alfonse,[N]
Sheeda.[A][X]

## Ch16EndingThePhysicalEmblemPlan

[FL]
I remember it well. All of the[N]
royalty of Elyos were there.[AN]
It was the third anniversary of[N]
Sombron's death.[AN]
And the third anniversary of[N]
Emblem Marth's "death".[AN]
We wanted to comfort our friend,[N]
when this stranger landed on the[AN]
Somniel. His words were simple.[N]
We wanted to hear them.[AN]
"Alear, I know a way to bring[N]
Marth back."[AN]
Her eyes lit up. Our spirits soared.[N]
Physical Emblems...[AN]
He would work with us to help[N]
Alear's dreams come true.[AN]
[Right]
Alfonse is working with Alear?[N]
I... didn't expect that.[AN]
But what of the dreams of the[N]
rest of the world?[AN]
[FL]
What of them indeed... We didn't[N]
care about them. That's what.[AN]
None of us ever stepped foot off[N]
of Elyos before.[AN]
Some of the help we've received[N]
included geographical knowledge.[AN]
Emblem Celica told us Valencia[N]
was where she called home.[AN]
But we didn't know where Valencia[N]
actually was. We thought that it[AN]
was on another planet entirely.[N]
A lot of planning was done.[AN]
The Divine One wanted Marth back[N]
first and foremost, so she[AN]
asked for help from Alfonse's[N]
friends. The plan worked.[AN]
Alear was over the moon. She[N]
was positively beaming.[AN]
[Right]
And the price of that smile was[N]
plunging Akaneia into a civil war,[AN]
that has now been running for[N]
three years and counting![AN]
Not to mention taking my husband[N]
away and trying to marry him![AN]
...Shouting at you isn't going[N]
to undo the damage. I'm sorry.[AN]
[FL]
No... You've every right to be mad.[N]
So does Alm. With Alear having[AN]
actually hugged Marth for the[N]
first time, she of course got[AN]
engaged to be married as soon as[N]
she possibly could.[AN]
And as for the wedding ceremony...[N]
I'm sure Marth told you of that.[AN]
[Right]
Yes. The thought of it makes my blood[N]
boil. What happened next?[AN]
[FL]
Of the Twelve Emblems, each kingdom[N]
had a ring publically granted to them.[AN]
The Physical Emblem plans followed[N]
in line with those, mostly.[AN]
Brodia went to Elibe. Solm went to[N]
Tellius. Elusia went to Jugdral,[AN]
they'd have been redundantly in[N]
Elibe otherwise.[AN]
Lythos went to Akaneia. And Firene[N]
went to Valencia.[AN]
[Right]
We've been to three of those[N]
continents...[A]
[FL]
The Divine One will stop at nothing to[N]
collect the Emblems once more.[AN]
Sheeda, you've seen the proof for[N]
yourself, haven't you?[A][X]

## Ch16EndingTheFateOfFirene
[FL][LoadCeline][Right][LoadSheeda]
I've endured two years of seperation[N]

[Right]
This is probably the best possible[N]
outcome that could have come out[AN]
of this. One question: what's the[N]

We must return to Akaneia.[AN]

Kris stepped foot on the Somniel a[N]
few times for discussions.[AN]
He's a ruthless, brutal man. How the[N]

with a man like him... For Marth,[N]
she'd stop at absolutely nothing.[AN]
Even here, I had dealings with a[N]
group just like Sombron's...[AN]
...Alear's just like Sombron.[N]
It all makes sense now.[AN]
Sombron would stop at nothing to[N]
reunite with the Zero Emblem.[AN]
Alear will stop at nothing to[N]
reunite with Emblem Marth.[AN]
...Sniff... I can't think of any[N]
other explanation.[AN]

Alear isn't really a Divine Dragon.[N]
Queen Lumera tried to change her[AN]
into one, but the process was never[N]
complete. We try to forget that.[AN]
But Alear's father - her blood father -[N]
is Sombron. She's a Dark Dragon.[AN]
This whole war to get the Emblems?[N]
She's not following in Lumera's[AN]
footsteps. No. She's following in[N]
Sombron's footsteps.[AN]
[Right]
So the "Divine One"... isn't[N]
actually divine at all?[A]
[FL]
Sigh... No. We all wanted her to[N]
be. That includes Alear herself.[AN]
But she's too far gone.[N]
I've been blind... no, I didn't[AN]
want to see. I don't regret our[N]
friendship for a second.[AN]
But Firene does not need to get[N]
itself caught up in this.[AN]
The world does not need to suffer[N]
for the sake of one person.[AN]
Sheeda, if you're willing to have[N]
me... Let me fight with you.[AN]
No peace can come from Alear's[N]
plan to rip everyone away from[AN]
their homes. I cannot be complicit[N]
in this war any longer.[AN]
If I want to stop this war, then[N]
I must do what is right.[AN]
And the right thing in this war[N]
is to fight with you.[AN]
[Right]
Celine, you're welcome to our[N]
army. For Akaneia... For Lycia...[AN]
For Valencia... For Firene.[N]
Let us save all of our kingdoms.[A]
[FL][MoveLeft]
I would be honoured. This morning,[N]
I thought I had to win or die.[AN]
But I was wrong. There is another[N]
way. Thank you for opening it.[A][X]

[FR]
Hello, Sheeda. Do you want to[N]
do anything tomorrow?[AN]
I'm exhausted from it all...[N]
...I could use a rest.[AN]
[Right]
Good timing, Lilina. I was just[N]
finishing talking to Celine.[AN]
[Left]
Lilina... The Queen of Lycia.[N]
I never stepped foot there,[AN]
but King Diamant did plunder[N]
what he could.[AN]
He found this trying to build[N]
a base in the desert.[AN]
[FR]
Forblaze. Please, return it.[N]
The Divine Weapons are mighty.[AN]
[Left]
As is only right. I have no right[N]
to use such a weapon.[AN]
One good turn deserves another:[N]
as Marth returned Venomous,[AN]
I shall return Forblaze. Here[N]
you go, Lilina. Take it.[AN]
[FR]
Thank you, truly. When this[N]
war ends, I will return it[AN]
to where it belongs. But for[N]
now, its use is necessary.[A][X]

## Ch16EndingVeyleOverhears
[FR][LoadVeyle]
...Just like Papa?! Alear...[N]
Papa?! What is she saying?![AN]
Is she... She joined Sheeda![N]
Celine... betrayed us?[AN]
No! I have to tell Alear.[N]
I have to tell everyone![A][X]

## Ch16EndingValenciaIsFinished
[ML][LoadMarth][MR][LoadSheeda]
[ML]
...We killed him. We killed Alm.[N]
Valencia is finished.[AN]
[MR]
We took the castle... We've[N]
made ourselves an enemy.[AN]
The people will never forget.[N]
The day Akaneia destroyed[AN]
the United Valencia, just[N]
passing on through.[AN]
[ML]
We're no better than Alear.[N]
We're trying to stop her,[AN]
and we just tore an empire[N]
apart while we passed by.[AN]
We're just two hypocrites,[N]
saying one thing, doing[AN]
another. I expect any[N]
Valencians with us have[AN]
deserted. I don't blame[N]
them in the slightest.[AN]
[MR]
If nothing else, we did at[N]
least kill an Elyosian[AN]
royal, and we recovered[N]
an Emblem Ring.[AN]
And even then, I think[N]
Celine had her doubts.[AN]
This whole affair reeks.[N]
We're disgraces.[AN]
[ML]
"Care for us, Emblem of Echoes!"[N]
Hah... Alm's the one who needed[AN]
to say that, save Celica.[N]
But hey... worth a shot.[AN]
[MR][MoveFarRight][Right][LoadCelica]
...Who are you two?[N]
I'm so tired. Where's[AN]
Celine gone? Wait, are[N]
you Emblem Marth?[AN]
[ML]
We're just a pair of murderers[N]
who destroyed your empire.[AN]
Alm is dead, because I was[N]
far too aggressive.[AN]
[Right]
What? Empire? Who are you[N]
talking about?[AN]
[ML]
Of course, Alear messed with your[N]
memory. Alm. Alm. Alm. Alm.[AN]
[Right]
Look, when Alear brings me back[N]
into my body, I'm going to have[AN]
to ask her some questions...[N]
Where's Celine, anyway?[AN]
[FR]
Dead. We killed her, and took[N]
the ring off her body.[AN]
[Right]
...No. You didn't. You...[N]
Alear will make you pay.[A][Clear]
[ML]
We got the ring, but the person[N]
now hates us. Another error.[AN]
[MR]
We need to leave. Get to Akaneia,[N]
and atone for this disaster.[A][X]

## Ch16EndingAlearGetsAProgressReport
[ML][LoadAlear][MR][LoadFramme]
[ML]
Everything's going from bad to[N]
worse around here![AN]
We've lost Celica's ring, too![N]
First Diamant gets killed.[AN]
Now Celine's situation is[N]
unclear, but I fear the worst.[AN]
That leaves Elusia and Solm.[N]
Framme, go find Ivy and Timerra.[AN]
They should be on the Somniel.[N]
I pray they have good news...[AN]
[MR]
Of course, Divine One! I'll be[N]
back before you can say "Engage"![AN]
[ML]
Be careful now. Don't hurt[N]
yourself. We've lost a lot[AN]
of people recently. Emblem[N]
Rings and friends alike.[AN]
[MR]
...I understand. I appreciate[N]
your concern, Divine One.[AN][Clear][.....]
[FFR][LoadIvy][MoveRight][....][FFR][LoadTimerra][MoveFarRight]
[ML]
Ivy, Timerra. How have things[N]
been going for you?[AN]
[Right]
Well, Emblems Sigurd and Leaf[N]
both lived in the distant past.[AN]
They are ancient history, and[N]
are well and truly deceased.[AN]
[FR]
Same here. I've wandered Tellius.[N]
They've some great meat there.[AN]
But seems like Emblems Ike and[N]
Micaiah are the stuff of legend.[AN]
A few people questioned if they[N]
were even real! I tried my luck[AN]
with the Bracelet Emblems,[N]
but I got nothing there too.[AN]
Soren was one of Ike's mercenaries.[N]
So he's dead too. How annoying.[AN]
[ML]
That's... very bad. We've lost the[N]
rings of the living Emblems,[AN]
and the rest of them are dead![N]
That, or we can't find them![AN]
There has to be a way to bring[N]
them back outside of corrupting[AN]
them. Such a rotten sensation.[N]
A Corrupted Emblem is no Emblem![A]
[Right]
Of course, Divine One. I have[N]
at least located the descendants[AN]
of the Emblems. Perhaps they will[N]
suffice as Physical Emblems?[AN]
[ML]
No... Sigurd is the Emblem. It has[N]
to be him. Not anyone else.[AN]
But we can't replicate Zephia's[N]
time-travelling crystal.[AN]
Can we find his soul, at least?[N]
It would be a start...[AN]
[Right]
I'll try my best, Divine One.[N]
If I can gain Sigurd and Leaf's[AN]
souls, perhaps we can give them[N]
a new body somehow?[AN]
[ML]
Timerra, go do the same in Tellius.[N]
Do whatever you must do to bring[AN]
back the Emblems. Stop at nothing.[N]
There shouldn't be any loved ones[AN]
threatening to foil our plans[N]
this time: they're already dead...[A][X]

[FR]
Divine One, Lady Veyle's in a[N]
hurry. A big hurry.[AN]
[Right]
Alear... I... I have some truly...[N]
shocking news. I can't believe it.[AN]
[Left]
Is it good news? I could do with[N]
some good news right now.[AN]
[Right]
Alear. This is the worst news I[N]
have heard since the wedding.[AN]
In fact... I would argue this[N]
is worse than the wedding.[AN]
Get everyone on the Somniel[N]
into the courtyard. This is[AN]
mandatory hearing. No...[N]
Elyos as a whole needs to know.[A][X]

## Ch16EndingCelinesBetrayal
[FL][LoadIvy][Left][LoadAlear][Right][LoadVeyle][FR][LoadVander]
[FR]
Well, I think that's everybody who[N]
isn't currently on another continent.[AN]
Lady Veyle, please tell us this[N]
shocking news. I'm terrified...[A]
[Right]
Alear... Everyone... We were betrayed.[N]
A few days ago Emblem Marth attacked[AN]
Sofia Castle in Valencia, and he won.[N]
We had lost contact with all units[AN]
stationed there. At first I assumed[N]
that Celine, like Diamant, was dead.[AN]
But then after the peace treaties[N]
were concluded, I took another look.[AN]
[FL]
A traitor? Someone betrayed the Divine[N]
One?! Who is it, Veyle?! Tell us![AN]
[FR]
It was mostly Firenese forces there.[N]
There must have been a set up...[AN]
//Off-screen shouting for now but would be nice to rotate in Jugdral bosses
[FFL]
You think the traitor was from[N]
what's left of Brodia?[AN]
[FFR]
Don't be crazy. Everyone knows[N]
Elusia just worships Sombron.[AN]
I think the traitor's from there.[N]
But who exactly is it?[AN]
[FFL]
Excuse me? Solm just buries its[N]
head in the sand all the time.[AN]
I think the traitor's from there.[N]
But who'd have the motive?[AN]
[FFR]
Forget all of that. For all of us[N]
to be gathered here, the betrayal[AN]
must have hit the Divine One hard.[N]
The traitor is Lythian![AN]
[Left]
While I appreciate all of you wanting[N]
to find out who this... despicable[AN]
individual is, aimless speculation[N]
isn't going to get us anywhere.[AN]
[FFL]
Hey, the Divine One was betrayed by[N]
an Emblem before. It could happen[AN]
again. How many of them are even[N]
left to betray her, though?[AN]
[FFR]
We've gone through all of Elyos and[N]
forgot the most obvious answer.[AN]
Firenese forces were in Valencia.[N]
It was probably one of them.[AN]
[Right]
So I went into Sofia Castle, and[N]
I could not believe my eyes.[AN]
Alear, the traitor is not just[N]
some minor officer. Not even[AN]
a retainer. No! The traitor is[N]
only Queen Celine herself!![AN]
[Left]
...Excuse me? Veyle, I can't[N]
have heard that right.[AN]
I heard that Celine betrayed me.[N]
That's a ridiculous idea.[AN]
If you're going to wind me up,[N]
at least say something plausible.[AN]
[Right]
It sounds insane to me too, but[N]
I know what I saw. I know what[AN]
I heard. She surrendered to Marth,[N]
which is surprising enough. But[AN]
then I overheard them talking in[N]
the cells. She thinks we're wrong.[AN]
She thinks we've gone too far.[N]
And now she's sided with Marth![AN]
[Left]
What exactly did she say, if you[N]
heard her correctly?[AN]
[Right]
She said "Alear's not following in[N]
Lumera's footsteps. No.[AN]
She's following in Sombron's[N]
footsteps." Celine's own words.[A][X]

Celine... you think... I'm... like...[N]
Sombron?! Of everyone... Sombron?![AN]
How dare she! That swine! We've been[N]
friends for almost as long as I've[AN]
been awake. We fought side by side[N]
throughout the war with Sombron.[AN]
She helped me through hard times.[N]
She was there for the wedding![AN]
Celine saw Marth betray us with[N]
her own two eyes! How could she[AN]
possibly think I'm in the wrong?![N]
I have to gather the Emblems again![AN]
It's what Mother would have wanted![N]
Ivy, what do you think of this?[AN]
[FL]
Betrayal of the Divine One is an[N]
unforgiveable crime. There is no[AN]
possible way to atone for it.[N]
Indeed, such treason carries but[AN]
one single penalty, Divine One.[N]
All that was Celine's is not.[AN]
Her kingdom is forfeit. Her[N]
possessions are forfeit.[AN]
And most importantly of all...[N]
Her life is forfeit![AN]
[Right]
There's nobody to rule Firene...[N]
Alfred is dead, may he rest in peace.[AN]
Queen Eve is unfit to rule... she's[N]
either broken or treasonous.[AN]
Still, Celine's with Marth's army.[N]
What will we do?[AN]
[Left]
Well, we must punish Celine.[N]
How about this. During the war,[AN]
Florra Port was attacked. Back[N]
then, I stayed and fought for[AN]
Celine and Alfred's sakes. Well,[N]
let us just say circumstances[AN]
have changed. Consider all[N]
trade with Firene outlawed.[AN]
A new dynasty will be installed.[N]
Once the new regime proves loyal,[AN]
then the sanctions will be lifted.[N]
But as for Celine... nothing can[AN]
be done for her. She has fallen[N]
from grace... Truly pathetic.[AN]
[FL][Clear][LoadHortensia]
Divine One... why? Celine was my[N]
friend too. I don't understand.[AN]
We have to gather the Emblems.[N]
Why would she want to stop us?[AN]
[Left]
Ah, Hortensia. Unfortunately,[N]
people do irrational things.[AN]
I think she was in Valencia[N]
for too long... grew attached.[AN]
Some people can resist these[N]
temptations, but not her.[AN]
Well, it was a nice friendship[N]
we had, myself and her.[AN]
Unfortunately, that friendship[N]
is now a relic of the past.[AN]
At the end of the day...[N]
Celine is just a defect.[A][X]
