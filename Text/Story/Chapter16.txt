## Ch16WorldMap
Marth stands at the front gate of Sofia[N]
Castle. The Kingdom of Sofia was founded[AN]
slightly over 200 years ago, though Mila[N]
held influence in the south long before.[AN]
Some sources suggest Doma and Mila were[N]
sibling Divine Dragons, exiled from Akaneia[AN]
by Narga during the Golden Age of Dragons.[AN]
These sources also attribute Thebes's fall[N]
to Doma. But not everybody agrees with this.[AN]
Some would instead argue they were truly[N]
gods, with nothing draconic about them.[AN]
If that's true, then they likely inhabited[N]
Valencia since time immemorial.[AN]
Regardless of the truth, they are now dead.[N]
Neither of Valencia's gods has any sway now,[AN]
and a foreign army is about to destroy a[N]
preciously rare symbol of a united Valencia.[AN]
Alm may regret his actions, but the wheels[N]
of time cannot be turned back.[AN]
He and "Celica" - Celine - appeared to have[N]
condemned Valencia to a crushing defeat.[AN]
Marth was not interested in destroying the[N]
continent. But could anyone convince Alm?[AN]
Valencia's only hope lay in cutting the[N]
Lythian strings tying Alm in knots...[A][X]

//I want Alear to scare Celine at some point, but how does she get into Sofia
//Castle at this point? Maybe move this scene somewhere else?
[ML][LoadAlear][MR][LoadCeline]
[ML]
It's been a while, hasn't it, Celine?[N]
I must say, you've been very efficient[AN]
at causing Valencia to implode.[N]
You sabotage some infrastructure,[AN]
do a deal with the Doma Faithful,[N]
and cause Alm to launch a doomed war![AN]
I didn't interfere, but I did hear the[N]
whole speech. Don't worry, "Celica".[AN]
I won't tell anyone our secret.[N]
Just keep doing what you're doing.[AN]
[MR]
How much of this is really necessary?[N]
Deceiving Alm is hard enough.[AN]
But bringing defeated cults back from[N]
the grave? Divine One, the Doma[AN]
Faithful are on par with Sombron![N]
Are you comfortable with helping them?[AN]
[ML]
We both know if Alm isn't dealt with,[N]
he could turn Emblem Celica against us.[AN]
There's no second Valencian ring, and[N]
he'd be a decent candidate for that...[AN]
//Conditional for number of rings lost
We've already lost a third of the[N]
original twelve Emblem Rings.[AN]
Doma isn't Sombron. He's one of the[N]
Dark Emblems. Unfortunately, we're[AN]
too late to find him alive...[N]
Why is death such an issue?[AN]
[MR]
Let me at least say this. Alm is fooled,[N]
but his inner circle are largely not.[AN]
I do look like Celica. But I'm not her.[N]
I want peace at any cost.[AN]
She wants peace, and fighting is a[N]
last resort. The others are noticing.[AN]
[ML]
Remember, you have the Ring of the[N]
Caring Princess on - that's what's[AN]
maintaining the illusion. Lose that[N]
ring, and Alm will have your head![AN]
Now, Celine, stop concerning yourself[N]
about what the Valencians think.[AN]
Frame them for treason as you've pinned[N]
this war on Marth.[AN]
I do regret you not exempting Kris[N]
from the declaration. He's an ally.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]
[ML]
That's forgiveable, really. Just go[N]
after Kain if you win, or return to[AN]
Firene if you don't. Just make sure[N]
Alm isn't a problem when you're done![AN]
[MR]
Of... of course, Divine One.[N]
May we save all Twelve Emblems.[AN]
[ML][Clear]
[MR]
...What am I doing?[N]
I am the Queen of Firene.[AN]
What does destroying Valencia[N]
have to do with Firene's[AN]
prosperity? But if I betray[N]
the Divine-- Alear...[AN]
Alfred is dead. I have no heir.[N]
I can't die here. I must live.[AN]
I must win. Whatever the cost.[N]
For the sake of Firene.[A][X]
