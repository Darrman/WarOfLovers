## Ch16WorldMap
Marth stands at the front gate of Sofia[N]
Castle. The Kingdom of Sofia was founded[AN]
slightly over 200 years ago, though Mila[N]
held influence in the south long before.[AN]
Some sources suggest Doma and Mila were[N]
sibling Divine Dragons, exiled from Akaneia[AN]
by Narga during the Golden Age of Dragons.[AN]
These sources also attribute Thebes's fall[N]
to Doma. But not everybody agrees with this.[AN]
Some would instead argue they were truly[N]
gods, with nothing draconic about them.[AN]
If that's true, then they likely inhabited[N]
Valencia since time immemorial.[AN]
Regardless of the truth, they are now dead.[N]
Neither of Valencia's gods has any sway now,[AN]
and a foreign army is about to destroy a[N]
preciously rare symbol of a united Valencia.[AN]
Alm may regret his actions, but the wheels[N]
of time cannot be turned back.[AN]
He and "Celica" - Celine - appeared to have[N]
condemned Valencia to a crushing defeat.[AN]
Marth was not interested in destroying the[N]
continent. But could anyone convince Alm?[AN]
Valencia's only hope lay in cutting the[N]
Lythian strings tying Alm in knots...[A][X]

## Ch16OpeningGoodJobCeline
//I want Alear to scare Celine at some point, but how does she get into Sofia
//Castle at this point? Maybe move this scene somewhere else?
[ML][LoadAlear][MR][LoadCeline]
[ML]
It's been a while, hasn't it, Celine?[N]
I must say, you've been very efficient[AN]
at causing Valencia to implode.[N]
You sabotage some infrastructure,[AN]
do a deal with the Doma Faithful,[N]
and cause Alm to launch a doomed war![AN]
I didn't interfere, but I did hear the[N]
whole speech. Don't worry, "Celica".[AN]
I won't tell anyone our secret.[N]
Just keep doing what you're doing.[AN]
[MR]
How much of this is really necessary?[N]
Deceiving Alm is hard enough.[AN]
But bringing defeated cults back from[N]
the grave? Divine One, the Doma[AN]
Faithful are on par with Sombron![N]
Are you comfortable with helping them?[AN]
[ML]
We both know if Alm isn't dealt with,[N]
he could turn Emblem Celica against us.[AN]
There's no second Valencian ring, and[N]
he'd be a decent candidate for that...[AN]
//Conditional for number of rings lost
We've already lost a third of the[N]
original twelve Emblem Rings.[AN]
Doma isn't Sombron. He's one of the[N]
Dark Emblems. Unfortunately, we're[AN]
too late to find him alive...[N]
Why is death such an issue?[AN]
[MR]
Let me at least say this. Alm is fooled,[N]
but his inner circle are largely not.[AN]
I do look like Celica. But I'm not her.[N]
I want peace at any cost.[AN]
She wants peace, and fighting is a[N]
last resort. The others are noticing.[AN]
[ML]
Remember, you have the Ring of the[N]
Caring Princess on - that's what's[AN]
maintaining the illusion. Lose that[N]
ring, and Alm will have your head![AN]
Now, Celine, stop concerning yourself[N]
about what the Valencians think.[AN]
Frame them for treason as you've pinned[N]
this war on Marth.[AN]
I do regret you not exempting Kris[N]
from the declaration. He's an ally.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]
[ML]
That's forgiveable, really. Just go[N]
after Kain if you win, or return to[AN]
Firene if you don't. Just make sure[N]
Alm isn't a problem when you're done![AN]
[MR]
Of... of course, Divine One.[N]
May we save all Twelve Emblems.[AN]
[ML][Clear]
[MR]
...What am I doing?[N]
I am the Queen of Firene.[AN]
What does destroying Valencia[N]
have to do with Firene's[AN]
prosperity? But if I betray[N]
the Divine-- Alear...[AN]
Alfred is dead. I have no heir.[N]
I can't die here. I must live.[AN]
I must win. Whatever the cost.[N]
For the sake of Firene.[A][X]

## Ch16OpeningHowToStopAlm
[Left][LoadMarth][Right][LoadSheeda]
Marth, how are we going to convince[N]
Alm to stop the fighting?[AN]
[Left]
Nothing we say is going to stop[N]
him. We're just a conquering[AN]
army to him. We need one of Alm's[N]
own subjects to speak to him.[AN]
[Right]
And "Celica"?[A]
[Left]
Well... what is there to do?[N]
She's Alear's proxy in Valencia.[AN]
It would take a miracle for us[N]
to persuade her...[AN][X]

## Ch16AfterPrepEveryoneTakesPosition
[Left][LoadAlm][Right][LoadCeline]
Everyone else is in position.[N]
Either we defend Sofia Castle,[AN]
or we die trying. We don't have[N]

[Left]
No, we don't. Grey is guarding[N]
the throne room. Mycen is at[AN]
the top of the stairs, and[N]
we have the balcony blocked.[AN]
If they break in here, we fight[N]
to our last breath.[AN]
[Right]
I have one last thing to take[N]

not be long. Please stay safe.[AN][X]

Hello again, (DOMA F). Remember our[N]

you give us assistance. It's time[N]
you held up your end of the deal.[AN]
[Left]
Ah yes. Your "Divine One" is very[N]
generous. Money has swelled our[AN]
coffers, and many are joining us.[N]
Will Alm be eliminated today?[AN]
[Right]
...Of course.[A]
[Left]
Oddly hesitant, aren't you? No matter.[N]
You've removed Celica for us, and she[AN]
did more damage to our order altogether.[N]
May Doma's blessings be upon you, Celine.[AN]
[Right]
Why... thank you. Now, I must fight[N]
the Akaneians: they are also a threat.[AN]
[Left]
Well, before you go, a friend of yours[N]
is here. She wants to see you.[AN]
[Right]
A friend? Who could that be?[N]
Is the Divine One here?[AN]
[Left]
She didn't give a name. Probably one[N]
of your Firenese buddies. Go on.[AN]
[Right]
Remember: keep up your end of the[N]
bargain, or you shall regret it.[AN]

Hmph... The money's good, but[N]
she's got that stench of...[AN]

So, it's true. As King Diamant said,[N]
you survived that shipwreck.[AN]
Louis died in that wreck, you know.[N]
I have no reason to lie to you,[AN]
Emblem Marth. I am Celine, Queen of[N]
Firene. I simply must win today.[AN]
[ML]
Queen? I swear on my honour, I did[N]
not kill Alfred.[AN]
[MR]
That wasn't your fault. He over-[N]
worked himself, all for Alear...[AN]
[ML]
Did you just say "Alear"?[A]
[MR]
The Divine One, rather. And for[N]
her sake... For Firene's sake...[AN]
I must defeat you. Your war is[N]
disturbing the world's peace.[AN]
The Divine One must collect all[N]
Twelve Emblems. Otherwise...[AN]
[ML]
Celine, do you even have any idea[N]
what miracle Alear wants to cause?[AN]
[MR]
I... I don't, beyond her just[N]
being happy to have them back.[AN]
[ML]
How selfish. You've plunged Valencia[N]
into utter chaos for the sake of[AN]
Alear's fantasy. Akaneia, Elibe,[N]
Valencia... Does this have any end?[AN]
[MR]
...I have no choice. Say I betrayed[N]
Alear. What of Firene? Of Mother?[AN]
She abdicated to Alfred, and isn't[N]
taking his death well as is.[AN]
If I die, Firene is finished![N]
Brodia's already crumbling after[AN]
you killed Diamant and Alcryst.[N]
I cannot allow Firene to follow![A]
[ML]
...I see. Very well. This talk is[N]
over. This war ends today. If you[AN]
obstruct the peace proceedings,[N]
what more needs to be said?[AN]
[MR]
...Nothing. Firene, Valencia, or[N]
Akaneia: at least one will fall.[A][X]

## Ch16GreyTurnsGreen
[ML][LoadClaire][MR][LoadGrey]
Claire! You're okay! And you're[N]
fighting with Akaneia?[AN]
[ML]
Grey, listen. Marth does not want[N]
a war. Celica has not come back.[AN]
Alm is being manipulated by an[N]
impostor. He needs to see sense.[AN]
[MR]
Look, Alm's been my friend for[N]
as long as I can remember.[AN]
I don't wanna be the guy to[N]
burst his bubble, ya know?[AN]
[ML]
Is Alm's bubble worth the end of[N]
everything Valencia holds dear?[AN]
Marth's army is trying to avoid[N]
causing casualties. He'd listen[AN]
to you, surely. Maybe not me,[N]
but he'd listen to you.[AN]
[MR]
I dunno, Celica's got him wrapped[N]
around her little finger...[AN]
But maybe General Mycen could[N]
get through to him. He's against[AN]
this whole war. Together... We[N]
have to get rid of "Celica".[AN]
That goes without saying. I'll[N]
help you get rid of her.[AN]
[ML]
If Marth is correct, her true[N]
name is actually Celine...[AN]
And her power is derived from[N]
a ring on her finger.[AN]
[MR]
Got it. Well, let's go. This[N]
Celine will regret ever trying[AN]
to destroy Valencia.[A][X]

## Ch16GreyPersuadesMycen
[ML][LoadGrey][MR][LoadMycen]
[ML]
General Mycen, the Akaneian forces[N]
are coming this way. They want to[AN]
negotiate with Emperor Alm directly.[N]
Please, let us through.[AN]
[MR]
...Yes. Fighting to the end is[N]
simply just a waste of life.[AN]
I may not have long left, but[N]
I cannot allow Alm to throw[AN]
his life away. We must persuade[N]
him to cease this folly.[AN]
And then see just what is wrong[N]
with Celica...[AN]
[ML]
Claire tells me she's a fake.[N]
Someone else replaced her.[AN]

off to me. We must end this.[A][X]

[FR]
Honestly, I can't believe you're[N]

a fairy tale right now. Should[N]
we really interrupt her majesty?[AN]
[Right]
Chloe, I must discuss things.[N]
I've been watching and observing[AN]
her actions after the shipwreck.[N]
Keep close to me.[AN]
[FR]
Let's just say I've not been on[N]
my best behaviour in Valencia,[AN]
and I'd really rather not be[N]
seen by Valencian forces...[AN]
[Right]
The Akaneians let you go, though.[N]
That's what fascinates me.[AN]
[FR]
What do you mean, Louis?[N]
Emblem Marth is still merciful?[AN]

Celine. Don't pick any fights![A][X]

## Ch16CelineWavers
[ML][LoadCeline][Right][LoadLouis][FR][LoadFace][0x01][0x01]
//Celine, Louis, Chloe
[Right]
Your majesty![A]
[ML]
...Are my eyes playing tricks on me?[N]
Is Akaneia returning the favour[AN]
I've inflicted upon Valencia?[N]
You cannot be Louis. He drowned.[AN]
[Right]
Officially, I have. Veyle's fleet[N]
recovered many objects and bodies.[AN]
But in truth, I washed up on shore.[N]
I couldn't find any other survivors,[AN]
so I decided to make my way to safety.[N]
It was a long, arduous journey.[AN]
[FR]
Why didn't you signal for help?[N]
Veyle would have rescued you.[AN]
[Right]
//No radar to fly under, no electricity grid to go off...
Disappearing for a time suited me[N]
fine, Chloe. Marth's forces[AN]
could well have charged onto my[N]
boat and killed me. But they didn't.[AN]
Why? There was no hesitation when[N]
fighting Boucheron or Clanne.[AN]
[ML]
They were directly occupying Talis.[N]
That's where Sheeda is from...[AN]
[Right]
I made sure to avoid any contact[N]
with any militant group on Akaneia.[AN]
I knew King Alfred had been working on[N]
Valencia, so I decided to head here.[AN]
I made it a few weeks before Marth.[N]
Then I simply started observing.[AN]
[ML]
...I see. Well, Louis? What did[N]
you observe, exactly?[AN]
[Right]
I arrived just before Celica was[N]
abducted. Valencia struck me as[AN]
a peaceful place. I saw her in[N]
person at a gathering, though[AN]
I didn't talk to her. Then she[N]
disappeared. The peace shattered.[AN]
Nobody had any idea who did it.[N]
I knew it was on the Divine One's[AN]
orders, but I kept quiet. She[N]
likes the chaos, does she not?[AN]
[ML]
Just look at Akaneia and Elibe:[N]
Elyosians all breaking them.[AN]
[FR]
Our orders were clear: remove any[N]
threat to Emblem Celica.[AN]
We all saw what happened with Marth.[N]
Most importantly, Alm.[AN]
[ML]
It feels like the Divine One has[N]
been getting... angrier lately.[AN]
Less willing to deal with anyone[N]
who aggrevates her.[AN]
[Right]
Everyone blamed everyone for a time.[N]
Then the Elibian ship arrived.[AN]
There was a battle at the border[N]
floodgate, which was soon sabotaged.[AN]
[ML]
Alm said at one point the old border[N]
had a flooding problem. Damaging the[AN]
floodgate would certainly destablise[N]
Valencia, so I had Chloe sabotage it.[AN]
[Right]
Officially the faiths of Doma and[N]
Mila were merged, but when I[AN]
attended a communal service one day,[N]
I mostly saw Mila's faithful.[AN]
The imperial merger of the religions[N]
was a failure, and a renegade[AN]
faction of the Doma Faithful started[N]
to gain influence again.[AN]
[ML]
They are the primary malcontents.[N]
Alfred identified them, and[AN]
I kept Alear's money flowing.[N]
They're a repugnant grouping,[AN]
and they summon Corrupted of many[N]
different types to fight.[AN]
How did the Divine One not notice[N]
any? She hates them![AN]
[Right]
Speaking of the Divine One, I saw[N]
her from afar very recently.[AN]
Rumour is spreading about how[N]
Celica isn't showing her face[AN]
and why: that's when I realised.[N]
The replacement plan was chosen.[AN]
[ML]
I do have a passing resemblance to[N]
Emblem Celica while engaged.[AN]
Enough to deceive Alm, but he must[N]
surely be close to the truth.[AN]
I was the one who encouraged him[N]
to declare this war. If I[AN]
got him killed, nobody could snap[N]
Celica out of Alear's control.[AN]
Valencia would be condemned to a[N]
bloody war with the Akaneian[AN]
splinters, and its destruction[N]
would be sure. Whose fault would[AN]
it all be? Mine. What does Firene[N]
gain from Valencia's fall?[AN]
[FR]
Your majesty, what are you saying?[N]
Are you suggesting that the Divine[AN]
One might possibly be... wrong?[N]
That this isn't correct?[AN]
[Right]
Chloe... I have always considered[N]
Alear to be a close friend.[AN]
Ever since the war with Sombron,[N]
I thought her heart was pure.[AN]
As does all of Elyos: she's the[N]
Divine Dragon, our highest god.[AN]
But ever since the Emblems left...[N]
Ever since Alfonse first arrived...[AN]
[Right]
Well, the notion of betraying the[N]
Divine One is... unthinkable.[AN]
But would she have endorsed our[N]
actions were this before Sombron?[AN]
[ML]
...Would she? She certainly would[N]
now. Anything to get the Emblems[AN]
back. But then? She was certainly[N]
kinder, more humble...[AN]
[Right]
It's not too late. Ultimately, the[N]
choice is yours. Continue serving[AN]
the Divine One, or chart your own[N]
course, free of the Divine One.[AN]
[FR]
...Betray the Divine One?! Louis,[N]
listen to yourself. We can't![AN]
Your majesty, when this battle is[N]
won, let's have a cup of tea and[AN]
Valencia's finest folk food. Our[N]
favourites. It sounds wonderful.[AN]
[ML]
Why yes, Chloe. That does sound[N]
wonderful. But for what?[AN]
I burn this empire down for the[N]
sake of a cup of tea?[AN]
I can't stand for that. Surely[N]
there has to be another way.[AN]
Marth has been our enemy, but...[N]
would he talk to me, too?[AN]
[FR]
Another way? What other way?[N]
Fairy tales are usually simple.[AN]
[Right]
But this isn't a fairy tale.[N]
Celine. The choice is yours.[AN]
We can continue as we were,[N]
defeat Akaneia, reclaim Marth,[AN]
and follow your orders, keeping[N]
Firene safe from any threat.[AN]
Or you could follow your heart and[N]
do what you think is right,[AN]
because a peace built on such rotten[N]
moral ground is worthless.[AN]
I have my own opinion, but this[N]
is not my decision to make.[AN]
[FR]
Emblem Marth's betrayed the Divine[N]
One, and has killed many of us.[AN]
But if he can avoid killing, he will.[N]
He's famed for his mercy...[AN]
But are we too far gone in his eyes?[N]
Peace with Valencia is not peace[AN]
with Lythos by any means. And we can't[N]
pull Firene alone out of the war.[AN]
[ML]
Who says we can't? I am the queen,[N]
not the Divine One. All of Elyos[AN]
may move in step with her, but[N]
by right we're sovereign nations.[AN]
But betraying Alear... The thought[N]
of it feels utterly repulsive.[AN]
But... yet... is it morally right?[N]
I can't believe I'm thinking of this.[AN]
[Right]
If betrayal is your choice...[N]
//Throw yourself at Marth's mercy.[AN]
//Alm will surely kill you when he[N]
//learns your deception.[AN]
You could throw yourself at[AN]
Marth's mercy, or Alm's.[N]
Make up for your sabotage of[AN]
Valencia, or join Marth's[N]
war for the sake of the world?[AN]
I will support your decision,[N]
regardless of what you pick.[A][X]

Allow me to recite an anecdote,[N]
to see if this helps you.[AN]
During the War of Darkness, I was[N]
friends with a man named Hardin.[AN]
A fine knight, virtuous and brave.[N]
He freed the slaves of Orleans.[AN]
Even his enemies respected him.[N]
And we got on very well.[AN]
[MR]
What does this have to do[N]
with me, Marth?[AN]
[ML]
Keep listening, Celine. Once we[N]
won the war, Hardin became[AN]
the King of Akaneia, having[N]
married Princess Nina. Sigh...[AN]
But Nina loved another, and[N]
Hardin was heartbroken when he[AN]
learned the truth. Soon his[N]
jealousy twisted him, and[AN]
in my friend's place was a[N]
tyrant, Dark Emperor Hardin.[AN]
[MR]
So... Hardin is Alear...?[N]
You're Nina...?[AN]
[ML]
I wanted to save Hardin. But[N]
when I fought him, he was[AN]
too far gone. The Dark Orb[N]
had consumed him, and I had[AN]
no choice but to strike him[N]
down with my own hand.[AN]
I did not like it. But I had[N]
to kill Hardin. And if any[AN]
of my other friends go the[N]
same way... I won't hesitate.[AN]
[MR]
...and I'm you. I understand.[N]
...Peace, at any cost.[AN]
Emperor Marth... I... know what[N]
I must do in this moment.[AN]
Alear... I'm so, so, sorry.[N]
Please forgive me... Sniff...[AN]
But... this is the right thing[N]
to do. I... sob... surrender![AN]
This is the Ring of the Caring[N]
Princess! Marth, take it. Give[AN]
this to Alm, and have him say[N]
these words:[AN]
"Care for us, Emblem of Echoes!"[AN]
After that, do as you see fit.[AN]

[ML][LoadAlm][MR][LoadMarth]
[MR]
I am Marth, the leader of this[N]
army. I desire a truce.[AN]
[ML]
Yes. I was manipulated into[N]
declaring this war.[AN]
Who I thought was Celica was[N]
a completely different person.[AN]
[MR]
She was Celine, Queen of Firene.[N]
My army is also at war with Alear,[AN]
Queen of Lythos and ultimately[N]
Celine's superior. Let us end[AN]
this foolish, foolish war, and[N]
discuss peace for our empires.[A]
[ML]
Yeah. Everything I was told about[N]
you was from an impostor.[AN]
So let's talk, and stop this war[N]
from spreading any further.[A][X]

## Ch16NoValencianTalk
[ML][LoadAlm][MR][LoadMarth]
[MR]
I am Marth, the leader of this[N]
army. I desire a truce.[AN]
[ML]
Don't try to fool me. I know you[N]
want to destroy Valencia.[AN]
Either I'll defeat you, or die[N]
trying. Draw your sword![A][X]

## Ch16EndingAnotherEmblemRing
[ML][LoadMarth][MR][LoadSheeda]
[ML]
Another Emblem Ring... If Celine[N]
was telling the truth,[AN]
then Celica is in Lythos.[N]
We must let Alm try to break[AN]
her free of any mind control.[N]
It's the only true proof.[AN]
[MR]
Indeed. One thing does bother me,[N]
though. Why did Celine tell us[AN]
Celica's summon chant? She seemed[N]
rather... doubtful at times.[AN]
[ML]
There are two possibilities. Either[N]
she was lying to us, trying to[AN]
waste our time with the ring...[N]
Or she started to doubt herself,[AN]
and decided to help us with her[N]
final breath.[AN]
I hope the second option is true.[N]
Was there another way?[AN]
[MR]
No. Even if Celine questioned[N]
Alear, she was still loyal.[AN]
No words of ours could make her[N]
change sides.[AN]
Maybe, just maybe, if someone she[N]
knew talked to her...[AN]
[ML]
There's no point dwelling on it.[N]
Celine is dead. We'll see if[AN]
her intentions are sincere if[N]
Alm can break Celica free...[A][X]
