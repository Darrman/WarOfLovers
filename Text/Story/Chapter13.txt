## Ch13WorldMap
With the expulsion of Marth's army from Elibe,[N]
Alear scored a great victory in her quest.[AN]
But Marth still draws breath, and the war[N]
is far from over.[AN]
//Time span should be properly calculated, put in a placeholder for now
//By point of comparison: it took Columbus five weeks to get from the Canaries
//to the New World, so six months is way too long. Off-screen non-canon islands
//to resupply, I suppose? Sure it's not important, but I want to be somewhat
//plausible with my long inter-continental ocean voyage to get to Valencia.
Three long months pass as the survivors of[N]
Lycia sail across the ocean.[AN]
The party's food supply dwindles, with only[N]
the occasional fish nourishing them[AN]
or a chance encounter with a desert island[N]
providing extra drinking water.[AN]
With the threat of starvation imminent,[N]
a reprieve rises above the horizon.[AN]
Though distant from Akaneia, its presence[N]
is still known amongst its people.[AN]
Marth had arrived on the shores of the[N]
continent of Valencia.[A][X]

## Ch13OpeningUnknownVessel
[ML][LoadValbo][MR][LoadClaire]
//Claire
Sir Valbo, good day. I'm sure[N]
you have heard of her majesty's[AN]
sudden disappearance recently.[N]
How could this have happened?[AN]
[ML]
I'm confused too, Dame Claire.[N]
Empress Anteze is more than[AN]
able to look after herself.[N]
Regardless, did you see any[AN]
unusual activity around the[N]
floodgate today?[AN]
[MR]
Yes, actually. A ship flying a[N]
completely unknown banner[AN]
is approaching the harbour[N]
on the former Rigelian side[AN]
of the gate. Emperor Alm's[N]
orders are clear: be on guard.[AN]
//Too bad there aren't any Elibian flags to use as colours
//Cipher colours it is
None of the former Akaneian[N]
flags had such a deep purple.[AN]
Perhaps they have a connection[N]
to the disappearance.[AN]
[ML]
It's highly likely. When that[N]
ship docks, I will detain it.[AN]
I have a lot of questions to[N]
ask the crew.[AN]
[MR]
I must return to Sofia Castle.[N]
Keep the floodgate safe: we[AN]
were too close to catastrophe[N]
during the unification war.[AN]
//Does FE2's war have a proper noun? Make one up if not
[ML]
Indeed. If this ship intends to[N]
open the floodgate...[A][X]

## Ch13OpeningLandHo
//just assume everyone is alive by default, conditionals later
//ideally I'd like to reach a point where Marth is the only mandatory character
//but I don't even have a Morodof/Jeigan figure here, so he'd be talking to
//himself if I did things in true FE1/3 fashion...
[Left][LoadMarth][Right][LoadSheeda][FR][LoadEliwood]
[Left]
Land? At long last... It's been[N]
weeks since we last saw any.[AN]
Is this another desert island,[N]
or have we found somewhere[AN]
more substantial? Is it inhabited?[N]
Is there food? Is there water?[AN]
[Right]
I see it too. If I can muster up[N]
the energy to fly over,[AN]
I should be able to take a look.[AN]
[Clear]
[FR]
To tell the truth, I was never[N]
properly trained as a captain.[AN]
I've learned many things, but[N]
I would like a rest.[AN]
[Left]
You've done well, Eliwood. When[N]
we finally get some shelter,[AN]
we can plan our next move.[N]
Shall I inform the crew?[AN]
[FR]
Sheeda's coming back. I didn't[N]
think she'd be here again so[AN]
quickly. Either her pegasus is[N]
exhausted, or...[AN]
[Right][LoadSheeda]
Marth, we've found proper land,[N]
and it is inhabited.[AN]
We've reached Valencian shores:[N]
I know the flag they're flying.[AN]
And judging by the amount of[N]
soldiers guarding the island in[AN]
the mouth of the river just to[N]
our south, this is important.[AN]
[Left]
Valencia?! How have we ended up[N]
here? Well, we should send an[AN]
envoy to the local garrison.[N]
If we can secure safe passage,[AN]
then we can easily return to[N]
Akaneia and end the civil war.[AN]
[Right]
It's almost been a year since we[N]
fled from Talis. What could have[AN]
happened in our absence? Maybe[N]
news has spread to Valencia?[AN]
Eliwood, there is a dock nearby.[N]
We should sail due east.[AN]
[FR]
Understood. Wake everyone up:[N]
we should be on guard.[A][X]

## Ch13OpeningInterrogation
[ML][LoadMarth][MR][LoadValbo]
I do not recognise your flag,[N]
and neither was I expecting[AN]
any arrivals here today.[N]
State your name and purpose.[AN]
[ML]
I am Marth, Emperor of Akaneia![N]
This vessel flies under the flag[AN]
of the Kingdom of Lycia. I seek[N]
safe passage to Akaneia.[AN]
[MR]
Emperor Marth? Ha ha ha... This[N]
is no time for jokes. Akaneia[AN]
is tearing itself apart right now.[N]
Emperor Kris is ruling with an[AN]
iron fist. His opponents are too[N]
busy fighting amongst themselves.[AN]
That Marth has just washed his[N]
hands of all responsibility.[AN]
[ML]
No I haven't, Alear abducting me[N]
was entirely involuntary![AN]
[MR]
Whoever you are, it's not funny.[N]
Marth has retired to Elyos with[AN]
Alear. I have no idea who and[N]
where they are, but this is[AN]
what I hear. Either that, or he[N]
fled to Jugdral, which I also[AN]
could not point out on a map.[N]
But I've never heard of that[AN]
Lycia country you claim to be[N]
from. I'm suspicious.[AN]
[ML]
Sir, everything I've said is the[N]
truth. Do you want to talk[AN]
to the Queen of Lycia for[N]
verification of that point?[AN]
[MR]
A likely story. You're either[N]
rogue Doma Faithful or pirates.[AN]
Emperor Alm ordered me to guard[N]
this crossing, and that is[AN]
what I'm going to do. Whoever[N]
you are, I don't believe you.[AN]
Troops, take him away. Perhaps[N]
then I can get a clear answer...[AN][X]

## Ch13OpeningWhereIsMarthAnyway
[Left][LoadChiki][Right][LoadSheeda][FL][LoadEliwood][FR][LoadLilina]
[Left]
It's been hours since Marth[N]
went to talk to the man[AN]
in charge here. When's he[N]
coming back? What happened?[AN]
[Right]
I would expect Marth to take[N]
a while talking with the[AN]
commander, but at this rate,[N]
the sun is going to set.[AN]
He would be on his way back[N]
by now if all went well.[AN]
[FR]
If this Valencia was friendly,[N]
we'd see Marth walking back.[AN]
I wouldn't rule out some sort[N]
of misunderstanding, but[AN]
I wouldn't have the knowledge[N]
of the regional politics here.[AN]
[Right]
Lilina, I have to admit that[N]
my knowledge of Valencia's[AN]
geography is poor. Usually we[N]
leave it to its own affairs.[AN]
But I do know the two kingdoms[N]
recently united into one.[AN]
[FL]
So there is only one authority.[N]
Either it is our friend, or[AN]
it is our foe. I pray that it[N]
will ultimately be the former.[AN]
[Left]
What if Valencia is friendly[N]
with Alear? What are they[AN]
doing to Marth? We have to go[N]
save him. We have to![A]
[Right]
We've waited long enough. It's[N]
most likely that Marth is in[AN]
that fort on the riverbank.[N]
I'll give the commander a firm[AN]
talking to. And if that doesn't[N]
work... I have my lance.[A][X]

## Ch13T1AnotherGrilling
//Fates sometimes goes "oh look at Corrin she's so nice killing nobody".
//How about I make the gaiden requirement "don't kill anybody"?
//This is the map where you're not to kill Dyute originally, after all!
[ML][LoadMarth][MR][LoadValbo]
[ML]
Could you at least tell me your[N]
name? Who are you?[AN]
[MR]
I suppose I can tell you that.[N]
My name is Valbo. I am a knight[AN]
of Valencia, and my job is to[N]
protect this floodgate.[AN]
[ML]
Why did you detain me? What about[N]
my friends on board the ship?[AN]
[MR]
They'll be in detention soon.[N]
I don't understand, though.[AN]
Nothing's out west from here.[N]
And piracy has never been a[AN]
major concern around here.[N]
If you are telling the truth...[AN]
Well, I'll have to see what[N]
your friends have to say.[AN]
[ML]
I swear on my life, I am telling[N]
the entire truth right now.[AN]
We were all involved in Elibe.[N]
Our stories will line up.[AN]
[MR]
These are dangerous times. You[N]
can't take anyone at their[AN]
word right now. That includes[N]
you, "Marth". If you are him...[AN]
That would change everything.[N]
I have no proof you're not him.[A][X]

## Ch13SheedaTalksToValbo
[ML][LoadSheeda][MR][LoadValbo]
[ML]
I assume you're the commander?[N]
Let's have a conversation.[AN]
Are you holding Marth captive[N]
somewhere in this complex?[AN]
[MR]
We both know he can't be Marth.[N]
//TIMELINE!
He disappeared off the face[AN]
of the earth about three years[N]
ago or so. Are you suggesting[N]
that he's returned from Lythos?[AN]
Does that make you Alear, then?[N]
Is your flag the Lythian one?[AN]
[ML]
Absolutely not. That flag is[N]
the Kingdom of Lycia's, and[AN]
I am not Alear. I am Sheeda.[N]
Empress of Akaneia, Queen of[AN]
Talis, and Marth's wife.[N]
Now, where were we?[AN]
[MR]
You do know about the divorce,[N]
right? Emperor Kris's coronation[AN]
speech made news over here, you[N]
know. It's hard to ignore him.[AN]
[ML]
Every word in that speech is[N]
a falsehood and propaganda.[AN]
You don't really believe that[N]
it's true, do you?[AN]
[MR]
I will admit, it sounded off.[N]
You remind me of some old[AN]
war comrades, actually. Akaneians,[N]
I think Macedonians specifically.[AN]
[ML]
Paola, Katua, and Est? I know[N]
they visited Valencia before.[AN]
[MR]
That's right. You know them?[N]
How could you know otherwise?[AN]
[ML]
We fought together in the Wars[N]
of Darkness and Heroes.[AN]
Paola and Katua at least could[N]
vouch for me in Macedonia:[AN]
Est disappeared after a messy[N]
breakup when the wars ended.[AN]
[MR]
I can't just take off to Macedonia[N]
to chat to people I haven't[AN]
seen in nearly a decade. But[N]
I can't explain it... I feel[AN]
like you're being honest here.[N]
I've got a lot to think about.[AN]
Marth's in the next room.[N]
Sheeda, you have a truce.[AN]
[ML]
Thank you, Valbo. We can explain[N]
everything inside.[AN][X]

## Ch13EndingConvincingValbo
[FL][LoadMarth][Right][LoadSheeda][FR][LoadValbo]
Alright, "Marth" is right here.[N]
If you try anything funny,[AN]
that will be the last thing[N]
you do, Sheeda.[A]
[Right]
I understand. Our armies have[N]
stopped fighting while we talk.[AN]
[FL]
Sheeda! Is everyone okay?[A]
[Right]
Yes. I tried to minimise[N]
Valencian casualties too.[AN]
//probably better to allow some wiggle room for the gaiden
//but still give special dialogue for zero deaths
We came from Lycia, fleeing from[N]
Alear's army of conquest.[AN]
Our ship flies Lycia's flag:[N]
a deep purple with a sword.[AN]
//The Cipher Elibe logo
I accept my word matters little[N]
in these dangerous times.[AN]
But I can prove that we came[N]
all the way from Lycia.[AN]
[FR]
If you have evidence, I would[N]
like to see it.[AN][X]

## Ch13EndingLetLilinaThrough
[FL][LoadMarth][Right][LoadSheeda][FR][LoadValbo]
[Right]
Of course. I'll bring the Queen[N]
of Lycia and the ship's logs.[AN]
I will be as quick as I can.[A][X]

## Ch13EndingLetLilinaThroughDead
[FL][LoadMarth][Right][LoadSheeda][FR][LoadValbo]
[Right]
I'd have preferred to have you[N]
meet the queen personally,[AN]
but I'm afraid she's no longer[N]
with us... I can still get[AN]
you the ship's log, at least.[N]
I will be as quick as I can.[A][X]

## Ch13EndingValboIsConvinced
[FL][LoadMarth][Left][LoadSheeda][Right][LoadLilina][FR][LoadValbo]
So, who exactly are you?[N]
Sheeda's sister?[AN]
[Right]
No, we're not related. I am[N]
Lilina, Queen of Lycia.[AN]
Or... I was the queen, anyway.[N]
Lycia has fallen to Alear,[AN]
and I had to flee for my life.[N]
Here's the ship's log.[AN]
[FR]
I see... Elibe? Lycia? Lythos?[N]
That is a long time at sea...[AN]
You all look exhausted too.[N]
You're all thin as a rake...[AN]
Alright, I'm convinced. Marth,[N]
you're free to go.[A][X]

## Ch13EndingValboIsConvincedNoLilina
[FL][LoadMarth][Left][LoadSheeda][FR][LoadValbo]
[Left]
Here's every log book we have.[N]
I hope this is enough evidence.[AN]
[FR]
I see... Elibe? Lycia? Lythos?[N]
That is a long time at sea...[AN]
You all look exhausted too.[N]
You're all thin as a rake...[AN]
Alright, I'm convinced. Marth,[N]
you're free to go.[A][X]

## Ch13EndingValboTheEscort
[FL][LoadMarth][Left][LoadSheeda][Right][LoadLilina][FR][LoadValbo]
[FL]
Thank you, Valbo. I must pass[N]
through Valencia in order to[AN]
reach Akaneia once again. May[N]
I get permission to pass?[AN]
[FR]
This floodgate is vital for the[N]
security of Valencia.[AN]
If it fell into enemy hands,[N]
Sofia would be washed away.[AN]
No passage is currently allowed.[N]
There is another way, though.[AN]
[FL]
What would that way be?[AN]
[FR]
I will send a letter to Emperor[N]
Alm requesting permission.[AN]
If he denies us, then I will[N]
escort you personally to Sofia[AN]
Castle. From there, Sofia Harbour[N]
is nearby, and you can set sail[AN]
to Akaneia from there. I apologise[N]
for detaining you earlier.[AN]
[FL]
No... I understand why you did[N]
what you did. I accept your[AN]
offer, Valbo. I don't want to[N]
involve myself in Valencian[AN]
affairs more than necessary:[N]
ideally we'll be gone soon.[AN][X]

## Ch13EndingNinaSpotted
//only play if gaiden obtained
[ML][LoadValbo][MR][LoadSheeda]
[ML]
Your highness, just before[N]
his majesty imposed sweeping[AN]
travel restrictions following[N]
the empress's disappearance,[AN]
an important Akaneian passed[N]
by the checkpoint here.[AN]
[MR]
We didn't send anyone ahead[N]
of us, if that's what you're[AN]
suggesting. Could you describe[N]
this person, please?[AN]
[ML]
Of course. She had long, blonde[N]
hair, and was in a pink dress.[AN]
She seemed to be searching for[N]
someone: my impression was[AN]
she was looking for Sir Zeke,[N]
though she didn't use that name.[AN]
[MR]
We have a few days before the[N]
emperor responds to your letter.[AN]
That description reminds me of[N]
Queen Nina. Who is this Zeke?[AN]
[ML]
A knight of Valencia. We don't[N]
particularly know each other,[AN]
but he's a very powerful man.[N]
Blond, wears black.[AN]
[MR]
Could that really be Camus?[N]
What should we do?[AN]
[ML]
The choice is yours. This won't[N]
get you back to Akaneia, but[AN]
it may prove important to look[N]
into. You have time.[A][X]

## Ch13EndingGaidenYesNo
[ML][LoadValbo][MR][LoadSheeda]
(Do I look for Nina?)[N]
[Yes][X]

## Ch13EndingGaidenYes
[ML][LoadValbo][MR][LoadSheeda]
Yes. If Nina is in trouble...[N]
If that is Camus... I'll let[AN]
Marth know. We are going to[N]
see them both safe.[A][X]

## Ch13EndingGaidenNo
[ML][LoadValbo][MR][LoadSheeda]
No. It doesn't matter. It's[N]
probably just a coincidence.[A][X]

## Ch13EndingAlmMonologue
[MR][LoadAlm]
Sigh... Celica, where are you?[N]
What can I do without you?[AN]
I try to keep Valencia together,[N]
but I'm a warrior first.[AN]
I'm more than able to crush any[N]
threats to this continent.[AN]
But keeping Valencia safe doesn't[N]
mean making Valencia prosper.[AN]
Celica was always much better[N]
at these aspects of leadership.[AN]
But Judah's faithful are still[N]
a threat, and Akaneia is looking[AN]
ever so dangerous. What if one[N]
faction or another was behind[AN]
Celica's abduction? If so, I[N]
will crush them. Wipe them out.[AN]
[ML][LoadMycen]
//Mycen
Apologies, sire, but someone[N]
has just teleported into the[AN]
castle. She left the hallway[N]
ablaze and is coming this way.[AN]
[MR]
What? Gramps, is the fire[N]
under control?[AN]
[ML]
Grey and Robin are handling it.[N]
As for our teleporting witch...[AN][X]

## Ch13EndingCelicaReturns

//Mycen, comment out ? man for presentation purposes
[Left][LoadAlm]
Who are you? You stand in Sofia[N]
Castle, in the united Valencia...[AN]
[Right][LoadCeline]
//Ideally engaged Celine, stronger resemblance
Alm! I have so much to tell you.[N]
When I woke up, I was trapped[AN]
in a prison camp across in Akaneia.[N]
Oh, the brutality. They had no[AN]
sense of decency about them at all.[N]
They had no tolerance towards[AN]
their fellow countrymen on the[N]
other side of the war.[AN]
[Left]
Celica? Is that you? I... can't[N]
believe it...[AN]
[FL]
Your majesty, with all due[N]
respect, are you quite[AN]
sure this is Celica? She[N]
can't teleport at will.[AN]
[Right]
Sir... Mycen, was it? Do not[N]
worry. This ring I found[AN]
granted me the ability to warp.[N]
I used it to escape the camp.[AN]
The damage to the castle is[N]
regrettable, of course.[AN]
[Left]
Celica, which group of Akaneians[N]
exactly captured you?[AN]
Was it Kris's faction, the ones[N]
claiming the throne right now?[AN]
Or was it one of the various[N]
rebel groups in the islands?[AN]
The last thing I want to do[N]
is end up attacking the wrong[AN]
group. I don't need to expand[N]
this empire - just avenge you.[AN]
[Right]
The Aritians. Led by a knight[N]
named Kain, the "Great Bull".[AN]
Armour red as blood, with a[N]
temper to match. There are[AN]
many more like him lining up[N]
to serve in his army.[AN]
[Left]
Aritia? Very well. Prepare the[N]
Knights of Valencia. Celica,[AN]
that Kain will regret ever trying[N]
to interfere in our affairs.[AN]
[Right]
Alm, wait! Is war against Aritia[N]
truly the solution?[AN]
[Left]
Of course... You're a pacifist at[N]
heart, after all.[AN]
[Right]
Western Akaneia has devolved into[N]
various seperatist factions.[AN]
I overheard a fellow prisoner[N]
say that Marth isn't in Elyos[AN]
at all, and that he's actually[N]
planning an attack on us![AN]
He's going to conquer Valencia![N]
We're a stepping stone to him![AN]
[Left]
Why didn't you tell me that sooner,[N]
Celica?! Most of the factions[AN]
pay lip service to him... which[N]
one, if any, is he backing?[AN]
[Right]
He's backing Kai-- no. I don't know.[N]
He's probably sympathetic to Kain.[AN]
But maybe that's a cover for Kris.[N]
Maybe he's using rebels in Grunia[AN]
or Macedonia to his advantage.[N]
Alm, I just do not know...[AN]
[Left]
Perhaps attacking them all is[N]
the way to go, then![AN]
[FL]
Your majesty, are you sure[N]
attacking the entirety of[AN]
the Akaneian Empire is a[N]
wise decision? We may have[AN]
a united Valencia, but our[N]
power pales in comparison[AN]
to our eastern neighbours.[N]
This could be a disaster.[AN]
[Left]
Perhaps, Gramps. But if one[N]
faction can just warp in[AN]
and abduct Celica, any of[N]
them can. Gather the knights,[AN]
and speed up the training of[N]
the new recruits.[AN][X]
