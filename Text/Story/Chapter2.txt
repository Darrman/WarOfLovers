## Ch2WorldMap
The Lefcandy Valley is the northern[N]
gateway to Akaneia. Many armies move[AN]
through this dangerous mountain pass:[N]
Marth's liberation army in the War[AN]
of Darkness was one of them. That time,[N]
Marth crossed from Orleans, to the north.[AN]
Now, Marth's destination is Talis.[N]
Kris's faction had long held the pass,[AN]
and the local populace support them.[N]
Marth's objective is to cross Lefcandy,[AN]
ideally without causing too much fuss.[N]
However, the pass is highly fortified.[AN]
[A][X]

## Ch2OpeningMarth
[MR][LoadMarth]
News certainly travels faster on[N]
horseback compared to walking.[AN]
So, Warren has fallen to Kris.[N]
That means as far as Akaneia[AN]
proper is concerned, Marich only[N]
holds Pales and Norda. Maybe[AN]
I should have defended Warren?[N]
No. I can't fight an army alone.[AN]
Kris's faction grows stronger.[N]
I must reach Talis, and quickly.[A][X]

## Ch2OpeningLyn
[ML][LoadLyn][MR][LoadFace][0x68][0x01]
//generic soldier
Lady Lyndis, an unknown figure has[N]
been spotted at the south of the[AN]
valley. Permission to attack?[AN]
[ML]
Yes. Rumours are spreading of an[N]
enemy of Kris fighting out of[AN]
Warren. In addition, if you see[N]
anyone with expensive jewellery,[AN]
you are ordered to capture them.[AN]
[MR]
Is it to do with the rumours of[N]
Emperor Marth's death?[AN]
Kris is ultimately loyal to Marth,[N]
and we are also loyal to him.[AN]
Did somebody discover and kill[N]
him?! Has the Shield of Seals[AN]
been broken once again?![AN]
[ML]
Emperor Marth is still missing.[N]
There is no reason to believe[AN]
that he has died in the meantime.[N]
Now, attack the trespassers![A][X]

## Ch2House1
[ML][LoadFace][0x5A][0x01][MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML]
I heard Warren has been liberated.[N]
Thank goodness. That means that[AN]
leech Marich is that bit closer[N]
to being toppled. He obviously[AN]
married that Ellis to get closer[N]
to Marth. That, and he plunged[AN]
Khadein into conflict because[N]
he stood against Emperor Hardin.[AN]
Kris never dragged anywhere into[N]
a war against Akaneia.[A][X]

## Ch2House2
[ML][LoadFace][0x5A][0x01][MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML]
You know the way Marth kept his[N]
pet dragon before he disappeared?[AN]
She disappeared not long after.[N]
One rumour I heard said she was[AN]
abducted by aliens. Another says[N]
she's a prisoner quite close by.[AN]
How you imprison a whole dragon,[N]
I wouldn't know. You can't fit[AN]
them inside a normal cell.[N]
Some say she was dealt with by[AN]
a Valencian passing through Pales.[N]
Do they even have dragons there?[A][X]

## Ch2House3
[ML][LoadFace][0x5A][0x01][MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML]
Emperor Marth was constantly[N]
harassed by assassins during[AN]
the War of Heroes. At every[N]
turn, Royal Guard Kris defended[AN]
him. The assassins even chased[N]
Marth all the way to the Ice[AN]
Dragons' Temple. Eventually[N]
one assassin turned her coat[AN]
and joined Aritia. Apparently[N]
she and Kris had fallen in love[AN]
at some point. How romantic![N]
Anyway, after killing Mediuth[AN]
Marth told Kris he was his[N]
other half, his true friend...[A][X]

## Ch2EndingLyn
[MR][LoadMarth]
And another of the Emblems[N]
falls. But... Lyn didn't[AN]
want to have anything to do[N]
with Alear or Lythos.[AN]
She belonged in Sacae, her[AN]
home. She belonged with her[N]
friends and family. Not dying[AN]
for some self-centred woman's[N]
collection of historical souls.[AN]
Now, I should investigate the[N]
area and see if there's anything.[A][X]

## Ch2EndingFindingChiki
[MR][LoadMarth]
Hm... It appears that Lyn didn't[N]
associate much with Kris's troops.[AN]
Just a few notes about recapturing[N]
the missing Emblem and preparing[AN]
the new one. I know I'm the missing[N]
Emblem. So who's the new one...[AN]
[ML][LoadChiki]
[MR]
...She wouldn't. Chiki?[N]
Are you okay?[A]
[ML]
[Beat][A]
[MR]
Oh no, no, no... What should I[N]
do... I don't know if there's[AN]
any healer nearby... Can this[N]
even be treated?[AN]
Wait a minute. If Alear did this[N]
to her, maybe this ring might[AN]
be the cure. Perhaps I bought[N]
the Emblem Ring-to-be off Anna?[AN]
[ML]
...Please... Someone...[N]
Help me...[AN]
Wait... Marth? Is that you?[N]
It is! You're back! And I feel[AN]
all whole again! Where were[N]
you, Marth?[AN]
[MR]
It's a long story, but it all[N]
begins with a man with blue[AN]
hair with some golden tips[N]
at the ends of it...[A][X]

## Ch2EndingChikiStory
[MR][LoadMarth][ML][LoadChiki]
Wow... So we're going to find[N]
where Sheeda is next, right?[A]
[MR]
Of course, Chiki. Now how did[N]
you end up here in Lefcandy?[AN]
[ML]
Lefcandy? That's where I am?[N]
Anyway, before you ended up[AN]
with Alear, that Alfonse man[N]
you mentioned tried to get me[AN]
to join that Order of Heroes![N]
I said no and he went away.[AN]
But before I could tell you[N]
about him, you vanished![AN]
A few weeks later, Sheeda flew[N]
off to look for you. She was[AN]
looking everywhere for you.[N]
A few weeks after that, that[AN]
Alear woman said you were in[N]
Lythos. I'd never heard of[AN]
that country before. She then[N]
offered to take me there. I[AN]
really wanted to see you again,[N]
so I said yes to her.[AN]
Then all of a sudden, I was[N]
knocked out. All I remember[AN]
after that is nightmare after[N]
nightmare, endlessly...[A]
[MR]
There, there, Chiki... You're[N]
safe with me now. I realise[AN]
something now. That new Emblem[N]
Alear was planning... it was[AN]
going to be you, Chiki.[N]
On that fateful day, when I[AN]
regained my freedom, Alear[N]
was going to summon an Emblem:[AN]
in other words, we'd both have[N]
been Alear's slaves.[AN]
[ML]
Does this ring on my finger[N]
have something to do with it?[AN]
[MR]
That would have been an "Emblem[N]
Ring". I don't know all of the[AN]
details, but they let Alear[N]
pull people from all history...[AN]
[ML]
That sounds very powerful. But if[N]
Alear was going to control me...[AN]
is it possible that she has a[N]
backup plan? Just in case?[A]
[MR]
It's very possible, Chiki. That's[N]
why we must hurry to Talis and[AN]
find Sheeda! Otherwise, who knows[N]
what could happen to her...[A][X]
