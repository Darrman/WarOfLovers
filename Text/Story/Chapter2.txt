## Ch2WorldMap
//The Lefcandy Valley is the northern[N]
//gateway to Akaneia. Many armies move[AN]
//through this dangerous mountain pass:[N]
//Marth's liberation army in the War[AN]
//of Darkness was one of them. That time,[N]
//Marth crossed from Orleans, to the north.[AN]
//Now, Marth's destination is Talis.[N]
//Kris's faction had long held the pass,[AN]
//and the local populace support them.[N]
//Marth's objective is to cross Lefcandy,[AN]
//ideally without causing too much fuss.[N]
//However, the pass is highly fortified.[AN]
//[A][X]
The Akaneia Marth has returned to[N]
and the one he departed are incomparable.[AN]
Gone is the peaceful United Akaneia. In its[N]
place is a brutal civil war.[AN]
For two years, brother has fought brother.[N]
Few change their minds diplomatically.[AN]
On one side is Marich,[Event] Marth's brother-[N]
in-law and long-time friend.[AN]
On the other is Kris,[Event] an ambitious army[N]
officer known for focusing on army training.[AN]
Kris maintains Marth promised him the throne[N]
should he ever take leave of Akaneia,[AN]
while Marich claims that with Marth and Sheeda[N]
absent from Pales, Princess Ellis, his wife and[AN]
Marth's sister, asked him to serve as regent.[N]
Both publically claim the throne is Marth's.[AN]
With Marth's return, these positions will soon[N]
be tested, but Marth himself is unwilling to[AN]
force the issue. His objective is to reunite[N]
with Sheeda first and foremost.[AN][Event]
His first goal is to cross the Lefcandy Valley.[N]
Kris's faction control it; its residents[AN]
support them wholeheartedly. Marth prepares[N]
an assault from the south.[AN]
Will he fall into another Trap of Lefcandy?[A][X]

## Ch2OpeningMarth
//Pretty stilted, rewrite
[MR][LoadMarth]
News certainly travels faster on[N]
horseback compared to walking.[AN]
So, Warren has fallen to Kris.[N]
That means as far as Akaneia[AN]
proper is concerned, Marich only[N]
holds Pales and Norda. Maybe[AN]
I should have defended Warren?[N]
No. I can't fight an army alone.[AN]
Kris's faction grows stronger.[N]
I must reach Talis, and quickly.[A][X]

## Ch2OpeningTomthAppears
[ML][LoadMarth][MR][LoadTomth]
Your majesty, it is an honour.[N]
I am Tomth, once a knight of[AN]
Akaneia. I haven't actively[N]
served ever since I resigned[AN]
my commission in the face of[N]
Hardin. I had retired here,[AN]
but most people here support[N]
Kris. I, however, do not.[AN]
[ML]
So, you wish to fight alongside[N]
us? I would gladly appreciate[AN]
that. Though that reminds me.[N]
Where is Mishelan?[AN]
[MR]
Sigh... We don't exactly see[N]
eye to eye anymore.[AN]
Last I heard, he was turning his[N]
band of watchmen into a militia.[AN]
This civil war is a disgrace.[N]
Everyone claims to be loyal to[AN]
you, your highness. We shall soon[N]
see which faction is truthful.[A][X]

## Ch2OpeningLyn
[ML][LoadLyn][MR][LoadFace][0x6B][0x01]
//generic soldier
Lady Lyndis, an unknown figure has[N]
been spotted at the south of the[AN]
valley. Permission to attack?[AN]
[ML]
Yes. Rumours are spreading of an[N]
enemy of Kris fighting out of[AN]
Warren. In addition, if you see[N]
anyone with expensive jewellery,[AN]
you are ordered to capture them.[AN]
[MR]
Is it to do with the rumours of[N]
Emperor Marth's death?[AN]
Kris is ultimately loyal to Marth,[N]
and we are also loyal to him.[AN]
Did somebody discover and kill[N]
him?! Has the Shield of Seals[AN]
been broken once again?![AN]
[ML]
Emperor Marth is still missing.[N]
There is no reason to believe[AN]
that he has died in the meantime.[N]
Now, attack the trespassers![A][X]

## Ch2OpeningRyan
[ML][LoadRyan][MR][LoadFace][0x6B][0x01]
Sir Ryan, an unknown figure has[N]
been spotted at the south of the[AN]
valley. Permission to attack?[AN]
[ML]
Permission granted. Apparently an[N]
enemy of Captain Kris defeated[AN]
some hired mercenaries and escaped[N]
Warren when it was captured.[AN]
[MR]
If I may, sir, I have been hearing[N]
rumours that Emperor Marth has died.[AN]
Kris is loyal to Marth, and our loyalty[N]
is ultimately to Marth as well.[AN]
Was he found? Was he killed? Will the[N]
Earth Dragons rise from the grave?[AN]
[ML]
Until proven otherwise, Emperor Marth[N]
is still alive. Now, attack![A][X]

## Ch2House1
[ML][LoadFace][0x5A][0x01][MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML]
I heard Warren has been liberated.[N]
Thank goodness. That means that[AN]
leech Marich is that bit closer[N]
to being toppled. He obviously[AN]
married that Ellis to get closer[N]
to Marth. That, and he plunged[AN]
Khadein into conflict because[N]
he stood against Emperor Hardin.[AN]
Kris never dragged anywhere into[N]
a war against Akaneia.[A][X]

## Ch2House2
[ML][LoadFace][0x5A][0x01][MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML]
You know the way Marth kept his[N]
pet dragon before he disappeared?[AN]
She disappeared not long after.[N]
One rumour I heard said she was[AN]
abducted by aliens. Another says[N]
she's a prisoner quite close by.[AN]
How you imprison a whole dragon,[N]
I wouldn't know. You can't fit[AN]
them inside a normal cell.[N]
Some say she was dealt with by[AN]
a Valencian passing through Pales.[N]
Do they even have dragons there?[A][X]

## Ch2House3
[ML][LoadFace][0x5A][0x01][MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML]
Emperor Marth was constantly[N]
harassed by assassins during[AN]
the War of Heroes. At every[N]
turn, Royal Guard Kris defended[AN]
him. The assassins even chased[N]
Marth all the way to the Ice[AN]
Dragons' Temple. Eventually[N]
one assassin turned her coat[AN]
and joined Aritia. Apparently[N]
she and Kris had fallen in love[AN]
at some point. How romantic![N]
Anyway, after killing Mediuth[AN]
Marth told Kris he was his[N]
other half, his true friend...[A][X]

## Ch2RecruitingRyan
[ML][LoadRyan][MR][LoadMarth]
Sir Ryan, you know this battle[N]
is completely pointless.[AN]
[ML]
How could you possibly be the[N]
emperor? He disappeared![AN]
[MR]
I have returned. My disappearance[N]
was not voluntary: quite the[AN]
opposite is the truth, in fact.[N]
I am Marth, Ryan. Believe me.[AN]
[ML]
...Okay. I was panicking. Forgive[N]
me, your majesty. I'm sorry.[AN]
[Event]
[MR]
I wish we came to an understanding[N]
sooner, but there's nothing to[AN]
be done. Ryan, did you have any[N]
orders from your superiors?[AN]
[ML]
//Alear wouldn't wait: she'd want the Emblem immediately!
//Rewrite this a bit: obviously she's staying here, so maybe some
//wires got crossed somewhere or Alear said X, Alfonse said Y
Captain Kris had my division guard[N]
Lefcandy Valley. A mysterious[AN]
woman has a prisoner held nearby,[N]
but we know nothing about this.[AN]
She has unnatural blue-and-red hair...[N]
She told us to avoid the prisoner.[AN]
[MR]
Blue and red? Then that must mean...[N]
Ryan! I have new orders for you.[AN]
Your division is to let nobody[N]
pass through the valley.[AN]
And you are to bring me to this[N]
prisoner immediately![A]
[ML]
Yes, sir![A][X]

## Ch2EndingLyn
[MR][LoadMarth]
And another of the Emblems[N]
falls. But... Lyn didn't[AN]
want to have anything to do[N]
with Alear or Lythos.[AN]
She belonged in Sacae, her[AN]
home. She belonged with her[N]
friends and family. Not dying[AN]
for some self-centred woman's[N]
collection of historical souls.[AN]
Now, I should investigate the[N]
area and see if there's anything.[A][X]

## Ch2EndingRyan
[MR][LoadMarth]
Ryan... One of the new recruits for[N]
the Grunian Expedition. I always[AN]
took him to be a loyal Aritian...[N]
But in my absence, who knows what[AN]
rumours have been spreading? Hm...[N]
If Ryan joined Kris's army, did[AN]
Gordon enlist with Kris too? Or is[N]
brother fighting against brother?[AN]
No matter the answer, I should check[N]
for notes or prisoners...[A][X]

## Ch2EndingFindingChikiOld
[MR][LoadMarth]
Hm... It appears that Lyn didn't[N]
associate much with Kris's troops.[AN]
Just a few notes about recapturing[N]
the missing Emblem and preparing[AN]
the new one. I know I'm the missing[N]
Emblem. So who's the new one...[AN]
[ML][LoadChiki]
[MR]
...She wouldn't. Chiki?[N]
Are you okay?[A]
[ML]
[Beat][A]
[MR]
Oh no, no, no... What should I[N]
do... I don't know if there's[AN]
any healer nearby... Can this[N]
even be treated?[AN]
Wait a minute. If Alear did this[N]
to her, maybe this ring might[AN]
be the cure. Perhaps I bought[N]
the Emblem Ring-to-be off Anna?[AN]
[ML]
...Please... Someone...[N]
Help me...[AN]
Wait... Marth? Is that you?[N]
It is! You're back! And I feel[AN]
all whole again! Where were[N]
you, Marth?[AN]
[MR]
It's a long story, but it all[N]
begins with a man with blue[AN]
hair with some golden tips[N]
at the ends of it...[A][X]

## Ch2EndingFindingChiki
[MR][LoadMarth]
Reading Ryan's diary it seems[N]
the rank and file of Kris's[AN]
faction are loyal to me. But[N]
they didn't recognise me, and[AN]
now this senseless battle took[N]
place. Now, what's this entry...[AN]
"Woman with red and blue hair[N]
was moving a prisoner through.[AN]
Said she was very important...[N]
Also ordered to keep away."[AN]
So Alear is in league with Kris.[N]
Now, who is this prisoner?[AN]
[ML][LoadChiki][CloseEyes]
[MR]
...She wouldn't. Chiki?[N]
Are you okay?[A]
[ML]
[Beat][A]
[MR]
Oh no, no, no... What should I[N]
do... What has Alear done to[AN]
you... Chiki! Wake up! It's me,[N]
Marth! Please, wake up![A]
[ML]
...Please... Someone...[N]
Help me...[AN]
Wait... Marth? Is that you?[N]
It is! You're back! And I feel[AN]
so much better! Where were[N]
you, Marth?[AN]
[MR]
It's a long story, but it all[N]
begins with a man with blue[AN]
hair with some golden tips[N]
at the ends of it...[A][X]

## Ch2EndingFindingChikiRyan
[Right][LoadMarth][FR][LoadRyan]
The prisoner is here,[N]
your majesty.[A]
[Right]
Thank you, Ryan.[AN]
[FR][Clear][Right]
So Alear is in league with Kris.[N]
Now, who is this prisoner?[AN]
[ML][LoadChiki][CloseEyes]
[Right]
...She wouldn't. Chiki?[N]
Are you okay?[A]
[ML]
[Beat][A]
[Right]
Oh no, no, no... What should I[N]
do... What has Alear done to[AN]
you... Chiki! Wake up! It's me,[N]
Marth! Please, wake up![A]
[ML]
...Please... Someone...[N]
Help me...[AN]
Wait... Marth? Is that you?[N]
It is! You're back! And I feel[AN]
so much better! Where were[N]
you, Marth?[AN]
[Right]
It's a long story, but it all[N]
begins with a man with blue[AN]
hair with some golden tips[N]
at the ends of it...[A][X]

## Ch2EndingChikiStoryOld
[MR][LoadMarth][ML][LoadChiki]
Wow... So we're going to find[N]
where Sheeda is next, right?[A]
[MR]
Of course, Chiki. Now how did[N]
you end up here in Lefcandy?[AN]
[ML]
Lefcandy? That's where I am?[N]
Anyway, before you ended up[AN]
with Alear, that Alfonse man[N]
you mentioned tried to get me[AN]
to join that Order of Heroes![N]
I said no and he went away.[AN]
But before I could tell you[N]
about him, you vanished![AN]
A few weeks later, Sheeda flew[N]
off to look for you. She was[AN]
looking everywhere for you.[N]
//Rewrite a bit: say she was taken prisoner by Kris at first
//Then Alear catches wind of things, knocks her out just prior,
//and then cast the memory-altering magic and introduce at wedding
//The nightmares can be of forgetting Banutu as a nod to how the brainwashing is
A few weeks after that, that[AN]
Alear woman said you were in[N]
Lythos. I'd never heard of[AN]
that country before. She then[N]
offered to take me there. I[AN]
really wanted to see you again,[N]
so I said yes to her.[AN]
Then all of a sudden, I was[N]
knocked out. All I remember[AN]
after that is nightmare after[N]
nightmare, endlessly...[A]
[MR]
There, there, Chiki... You're[N]
safe with me now. I realise[AN]
something now. That new Emblem[N]
Alear was planning... it was[AN]
going to be you, Chiki.[N]
On that fateful day, when I[AN]
regained my freedom, Alear[N]
was going to summon an Emblem:[AN]
in other words, we'd both have[N]
been Alear's slaves.[AN]
[ML]
Does this ring on my finger[N]
have something to do with it?[AN]
[MR]
That would have been an "Emblem[N]
Ring". I don't know all of the[AN]
details, but they let Alear[N]
pull people from all history...[AN]
[ML]
That sounds very powerful. But if[N]
Alear was going to control me...[AN]
is it possible that she has a[N]
backup plan? Just in case?[A]
[MR]
It's very possible, Chiki. That's[N]
why we must hurry to Talis and[AN]
find Sheeda! Otherwise, who knows[N]
what could happen to her...[A][X]

## Ch2EndingChikiStory
[MR][LoadMarth][ML][LoadChiki]
Wow... So we're going to find[N]
where Sheeda is next, right?[A]
[MR]
Of course, Chiki. Now how did[N]
you end up here in Lefcandy?[AN]
[ML]
Lefcandy? That's where I am?[N]
Anyway, before you ended up[AN]
with Alear, that Alfonse man[N]
you mentioned tried to get me[AN]
to join that Order of Heroes![N]
I said no and he went away.[AN]
But before I could tell you[N]

offered to take me there. I[AN]
really wanted to see you again,[N]
so I said yes to her.[AN]
Then all of a sudden, I was[N]
knocked out. After that... it[AN]
was so dark... so cold. And[N]
I kept having nightmares...[A]
[MR]
There, there, Chiki... You're[N]
safe with me now. I realise[AN]
something now. Chiki, Alear was[N]
going to turn you into her[AN]
newest Emblem.[N]
On that fateful day, when I[AN]
regained my freedom, Alear was[N]
about to "introduce" an Emblem[AN]
to Lythos: in other words, put[N]
you in the same situation as I[AN]
was - a slave of Alear's, your[N]
power at her command.[A]
[ML]
Just like when Garnef hypnotised[N]
me? That time was horrible...[AN]
Thank you, Marth! I knew you'd come[N]
to save me. But if Alear was going[AN]
to control me... is it possible she[N]
has a backup plan? Just in case?[AN]
[MR]
It's very possible, Chiki. That's[N]
why we must hurry to Talis and[AN]
find Sheeda! Otherwise, who knows[N]
