[ML][LoadAlm]
This has gone on for long enough![N]
Celica vanishes without so much as[AN]
saying goodbye, the old Doma Faithful[N]
grow more agitated by the day, and[AN]
the way things are going in Akaneia[N]
I'll have to have daily naval patrols[AN]
to the east![A]
[FFR]
#Celine posing as Celica; we won't see this for lack of assets
Alm... I'm back. It[N]
was the Akaneians.[A]
[ML]
Celica... is that you?[A][X]

## ElibianScene
[ML][LoadLilina][MR][LoadEliwood]
Guinevere's acceptance as Queen of Bern[N]
is far from universal. Her opponents[AN]
consider her a usurper, installed[N]
by Roy.[AN]
[ML]
And in Etruria, Roartz's faction didn't[N]
die with him. They blame Roy for[AN]
dismantling their colonies. And with him[N]
gone, now's their chance to re-establish[AN]
control...[A][X]

## JugdralianScene
[ML][LoadCelice][MR][LoadOifaye]
[ML]
What is there to do? Some want us to[N]
reclaim Jungby and Velthomer. Others[AN]
want a republic established. Rebels[N]
threaten to detach the remaining[AN]
duchies. Miletos is preparing to[N]
invade Chalphy, and if my family's[AN]
namesake falls, so do we.[AN]
[MR]
Your highness, there are protestors[N]
outside the palace. It's about the[AN]
rumours of Lord Sigurd's spirit[N]
condemning modern Grandbell...[A][X]

## AkaneianScene
[ML][LoadKris][MR][LoadMarich]
Kris, you revisionist snake... You[N]
have half of Akaneia fooled with[AN]
your lies. You never fought in the[N]
War of Heroes. How you rose through[AN]
the ranks of the army I don't know.[N]
But you are not Marth's other half.[A]
[ML]
Whether I am or not in reality matters[N]
little, so long as Akaneia believes me.[A][X]
