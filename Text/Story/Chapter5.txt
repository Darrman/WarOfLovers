## Ch5WorldMap
The isle of Talis has always been isolated.[N]
Situated at the eastern edge of Akaneia,[AN]
it had long been inhabited by squabbling[N]
tribes. King Mostyn changed this in 579,[AN]
35 years ago, and unified the island[N]
with the help of his friend, Lawrence of[AN]
Grunia. Mostyn was also friends with King[N]
Cornelius, Marth's father. This friendship[AN]
resulted in Marth fleeing to Talis with the[N]
last of the Aritian knights and living there[AN]
for two years during the War of Darkness;[AN]
Mostyn was a true friend of Cornelius, unlike[N]
the treacherous Jiol of Gra, who killed him.[AN]
Talis remained as undisturbed as ever,[N]
leaving the young prince to train for his[AN]
battle against Dark Dragon Mediuth[N]
and get to know Mostyn's daughter, Sheeda.[AN]
This was abruptly cut short by the Garda[N]
Pirates under Gazack's leadership in 604.[AN]
Marth drove them out and begun his campaign[N]
against Durhua; Sheeda accompanied him,[AN]
along with his knights. Much has changed[N]
in the intervening decade. Lawrence, too,[AN]
fell to treachery; his rebellion against[N]
Hardin ultimately sparked the War of Heroes.[AN]
In the end, age is what claimed Mostyn, but[N]
not before he saw his daughter happily married.[AN]
Marth and Sheeda's marraige saw Talis brought[N]
under the control of a United Akaneia.[AN]
The couple promised peace, but the emperor's[N]
disappearance has only brought strife.[AN]
Now, a massive fleet stares Talis down, far[N]
larger than Gazack's raid ever was.[AN]
Alear is now occupying Mostyn's throne, and[N]
Sheeda knows her home hangs in the balance...[A][X]

## Ch5ThatMeddlingSheeda
[ML][LoadAlear][MR][LoadGoon]
[ML]
So, this is the Kingdom of Talis?[N]
It's so small, so isolated.[AN]
Was there anything of value on this[N]
lonely little rock at all?[AN]
[MR]
Divine One, our capture of Talis was an[N]
amazing success. Your tactical acumen[AN]
is second to one. Our naval blockade[N]
prevented any supplies from reaching[AN]
the island. Without any weapons, the[N]
castle garrison were helpless.[A]
[ML]
Indeed. I'm just disappointed that[N]
I didn't find Sheeda here. This is[AN]
her homeland; Kris said she moved[N]
here after Marth became solid.[AN]
Still, we have a deal. Talis is to[N]
become a part of Lythos. And much[AN]
work needs to be done here so it[N]
all fits in properly![A]
[MR]
Divine One, if I may, why do you[N]
seek to annex land beyond Elyos?[AN]
Solidifying the Emblems does not[N]
require we control any territory.[AN]
[ML]
It doesn't, Vander. I want Talis[N]
for other reasons. First, moving[AN]
from the Somniel takes a long time,[N]
and it will be useful to talk to[AN]
Kris as well. Akaneia is so far away[N]
from Elyos. We need a base here.[AN]
Of course, this castle might not be[N]
suitable. It might need rebuilding.[A]
[MR]
But building castles is very expensive,[N]
Divine One. King Diamant has just put[AN]
in a request for funds in his campaign:[N]
I see no point in any demolitions here.[A]
[ML]
Don't question my ideas, Vander! But,[N]
if you must know, it's because I'm...[AN]
jealous. I love Marth, and I thought[N]
he loved me too! I just wanted to get[AN]
married and live with all the Emblems,[N]
all given physical form! But oh no,[AN]
it turns out he had fallen in love[N]
with another woman. And he had went[AN]
and married her! Well, I'll show that[N]
meddling Sheeda who's she's messing[AN]
with! Step one, conquer Talis! That[N]
step has been completed.[AN]
[MR]
As you know, Marth escaping led to[N]
the disruption that led to our[AN]
Emblem Chiki plan going wrong. Did[N]
we target the wrong person, perhaps?[AN]
[ML]
No... Marth holds that so-called Divine[N]
Dragon dear as well. Still, her power[AN]
is great: we should reclaim her along[N]
with Marth. But where is he?[AN]
[MR]
Somewhere in Akaneia, Divine One. But[N]
where exactly, I don't know. Anyway,[AN]
I have interrupted you for long enough.[N]
Continue your plot against Sheeda.[AN]
[ML]
Step two, hold the wedding! Marth[N]
will surely say "I do" this time,[AN]
and Sheeda will be the guest of[N]
honour. She'll watch every second[AN]
of the ceremony, and she'll have[N]
a front row seat for Emblem Chiki's[AN]
debut! Finally, and this step might[N]
take a while, but if we can make a[AN]
new Emblem Ring for her... Emblem[N]
Sheeda will bother me no more.[AN]
In fact, she'll be one of us! That[N]
way, it all ends happily ever after.[AN]
[MR]
Bravo, Divine One. That is a fantastic[N]
plan, that Lythos will surely approve[AN]
of. I might write the speech in a more[N]
sympathetic manner: the people need not[AN]
know the Divine One is jealous of... an[N]
Emblem's wife? It's hard to believe...[A][X]

## Ch5OffTheBoat
[ML][LoadMarth][MR][LoadSheeda]
We've made it home. Marth, Alear's[N]
soldiers are like fanatics.[AN]
Their loyalty to the "Divine One"[N]
is absolute. I can't think of any[AN]
way to recruit one to our cause...[AN]
[ML]
Don't worry about it, Sheeda. Look,[N]
Talis Castle isn't well-guarded[AN]
at the moment. If we sneak in and[N]
defeat Alear, this might just end.[AN]
We won't lose to a gang of mindless[N]
bootlickers. Come on, Sheeda:[AN]
let's return to Talis Castle![A][X]

## Ch5ConfrontingAlear
[Left][LoadAlear][FL][LoadGoon][Right][LoadMarth][FR][LoadSheeda]
[FL]
Divine One, we are under attack![N]
What should we do?[AN]
[Left]
What?! What were the guards doing?[N]
Grrr... Does that mean the Garda[AN]
attack failed? But Sheeda and Rody[N]
had so few men at their command...[AN]
[FR]
Alear! Why have you taken over my[N]
country?! Why do you interfere?![AN]
[Right]
We meet again, Alear. I spent some[N]
of my formative years here on Talis.[AN]
What brings you attempting to raze[N]
it to the ground?[AN]
[Left]
Marth... it's really you. Please, come[N]
back to your senses! Come back with[AN]
me to Lythos... We can be happy again,[N]
like we used to be.[AN]
[Right]
You've supported a rebellion in my[N]
empire. You've separated me from[AN]
my wife, and now you've overrun her[N]
country. Talis will never be yours,[AN]
and I will always be Sheeda's! And[N]
nothing will ever change that![A][X]

## Ch5AfterScriptedBattle
[Left][LoadAlear][FL][LoadGoon][Right][LoadMarth][FR][LoadSheeda]
[Left]
Ouch... The Falchion... Designed to[N]
slay dragons... Just like me...[AN]
What is Sheeda doing to you, Marth?[N]
Why did you attack me? And with[AN]
such a dangerous weapon? I can't stay[N]
here. Vander! We must retreat![A][Clear][FL][Clear]
[Right][MoveMidLeft][FR][MoveRight]
[ML]
Damn... She's gone. Back to the[N]
Somniel, most likely.[AN]
[Right]
I get a distinct feeling that my[N]
existence is an obstacle in[AN]
Alear's plans... I think she hates[N]
me personally for daring to marry[AN]
you. All that "Divine One" worship[N]
must be going to her head...[A]
[ML]
Alear may have fled, but I doubt her[N]
troops have made a full retreat.[AN]
It's likely a commander is based in[N]
the fort I lived in all those years[AN]
ago. To think that I must now attack[N]
the fortress that protected me...[AN]
[Right]
We'll have to be careful. Alear's[N]
navy is still massive, and I'm[AN]
sure she has more troops waiting[N]
on board. Still, we won't be at[AN]
peace until this invasion is pushed[N]
back. We can't afford to wait.[AN]
[ML]
You're right, Sheeda. Who knows[N]
what her men have been ordered[AN]
to do. We will not give them a[N]
chance to carry those orders out![A][X]

## Ch5BossTaunt
[MR][LoadClanne]
The Divine One needs me to protect[N]
this fort, and so that's what I am[AN]
going to do. I'm surprised we're[N]
under attack, though. I suppose that[AN]
means Boucheron's unit has failed.[N]
Still, unless Sheeda found herself[AN]
hundreds of extra soldiers, Talis[N]
will fall. For the Divine Dragon![A][X]

## Ch5RiffVillage
[MR][LoadCurrent][ML][LoadFace][0x5F][0x01]
You're with Emperor Marth's army,[N]
aren't you? Father Riff joined him[AN]
when he freed us from the Garda[N]
Pirates. His monastery is nearby.[AN]
I had wanted to give Marth this[N]
vulnerary, but he never actually[AN]
saw me that day. I'm sure he'd[N]
want something more useful...[AN]
Here's a Dragon Shield. Wear it[N]
and you'll never have to drink[AN]
a vulnerary again! It won't save[N]
you from a mage's flames, though...[A][X]

## Ch5MoneyVillage
[MR][LoadCurrent][ML][LoadFace][0x5F][0x01]
Oh, these Lythians are awful![N]
They demanded every ounce of[AN]
gold we had. Their commander[N]
muttered something about their[AN]
diamond mines, I think? If they[N]
have diamonds, surely they could[AN]
leave us poor Talisians alone![N]
One more thing: this stranger[AN]
turned up the other day and wants[N]
to fight for Marth. Be good![A][X]

## Ch5RuinedVillageText
[MR][LoadCurrent][ML][LoadFace][0x5F][0x01]
Are we ever going to get a break?[N]
We finally finished rebuilding[AN]
after Gazack's pirates demolished[N]
the place and now this Lythos crew[AN]
are lording over Talis! I've asked[N]
everyone I know if they've heard[AN]
of it, and everyone says the first[N]
they heard of it was when Marth[AN]
divorced Sheeda. Hardly anyone[N]
believes that, though. If it's[AN]
true, I won't complain: I can try[N]
my luck! Here, take this silver[AN]
lance. Sheeda has an eye for this[N]
stuff, so I'm sure she'll like it.[A][X]

## Ch5House1Text
[MR][LoadCurrent][ML][LoadFace][0x5F][0x01]
Talis is the edge of the world. Nothing[N]
has been found any further east.[AN]
Well, they say the continent of Jugdral[N]
is somewhere to the east of Talis.[AN]
But the sea is vast and few make the[N]
journey. You seem well-travelled.[AN]
Perhaps you might want to visit Jugdral.[N]
In that case, take care and good luck.[A][X]

## Ch5House2Text
[MR][LoadCurrent][ML][LoadFace][0x5F][0x01]
There used to be a powerful mercenary[N]
captain guarding Talis. His name was[AN]
Oguma, and you didn't mess with him.[N]
His loyalty was less towards Talis and[AN]
more towards Empress Sheeda personally.[N]
Once she got married, Oguma vanished.[AN]
Nobody's seen him since, but I'm sure[N]
he's around somewhere. He was born[AN]
in Peraty, so if I had to guess, he's[N]
returned home to heal a broken heart...[A][X]

## Ch5House3Text
[MR][LoadCurrent][ML][LoadFace][0x5F][0x01]
You could sail up the coast to the[N]
north, but you won't really find[AN]
anything there. The occasional pirate[N]
base, a few rocky islands, and[AN]
eventually icebergs. If you were[N]
on the run, it might be a good[AN]
place to hide. There's the occasional[N]
rumour of fabulous temples built[AN]
by the dragons; maybe there's some[N]
treasure lying around?[A][X]

## Ch5House4Text
[MR][LoadCurrent][ML][LoadFace][0x5F][0x01]
You'll never believe the gossip I[N]
heard in the pub. General Camus,[AN]
you know, that Grunian general[N]
Nina of Akaneia pines for... is[AN]
alive! Somehow he washed up all[N]
the way over in Valencia! I also[AN]
heard he settled down over there[N]
with a local woman. If Nina heard[AN]
that, who knows what she'd do? She[N]
abdicated from holy Akaneia...[AN]
You know what? If Camus defected,[N]
eight years worth of trouble[AN]
would just melt away. It's a shame[N]
that's not how it went down, eh?[A][X]

## Ch5House5Text
[MR][LoadCurrent][ML][LoadFace][0x5F][0x01]
I try to keep tabs on Emperor Marth's[N]
two major armies and where everyone[AN]
is. Est divorced Abel,  and neither[N]
have been seen since. Navarre vanished,[AN]
and Feena vanished with him. Malliesia[N]
took off without a word; what's she[AN]
getting up to? The point is, people[N]
disappear sometimes. But they're all[AN]
somewhere in the world. You might just[N]
have to look beyond Akaneia sometimes.[A][X]

Talis's eastern fortress... The[N]
fort I spent my years in exile.[AN]
And now, it's free from the enemy.[N]
What should we do now?[A]

to show you. Follow me.[A][X]

## Ch5MostynGrave

[ML]
Well, Marth... While you were gone,[N]
my father... passed away. He went[AN]
peacefully, thankfully. He's buried[N]
here. He was my only blood relative...[AN]
[Right]
King Mostyn of Talis... I owe you a[N]
great debt of gratitude. I would[AN]
never have escaped Aritia if you[N]
did not offer my knights shelter.[AN]
Otherwise, I would probably be dead.[N]
I'm sorry I couldn't see you off...[AN]
I can only hope you forgive me. Rest[N]
assured that I will keep Sheeda happy.[A]
[FFR][LoadChiki][MoveFarRight]
Oh, Marth! This is where you are.[N]
What are you doing here?[AN]
[ML]
Shh... This is a graveyard.[N]
Marth is paying his respects...[AN]
[FR]
Oh... I'm sorry. Who's he[N]
paying his respects to?[A]
[ML]
...My father. He... he is no[N]
longer with us, Chiki.[AN]
He was always willing to help[N]
a friend... You'd like him.[AN]
[FR]
Better than my parents...[N]
The Divine Dragon King put[AN]
me to sleep as soon as I was[N]
born. I don't want to sleep[AN]
for my whole life. Banutu is[N]
more of a father than my[AN]
actual father ever was...[N]
I'd never have met any of[AN]
you if Banutu didn't wake me[N]
up. Gato would make me sleep[AN]
forever just because Narga[N]
ordered him to ages ago![AN]
[Right]
Shh... There, there, Chiki.[N]
I'll be here for you. You[AN]
won't need to sleep forever.[N]
We're your friends.[AN]
Let's go. I need to figure out[N]
what we will do next.[A][X]

## Ch5AlfonseAppears
[ML][LoadMarth][MR][LoadAlfonse]
[MR]
So, this is where you've ended[N]
up. Emperor Marth of Akaneia.[AN]
The Hero King, the Star Lord...[N]
You've earned no shortage of[AN]
accolades in your campaigns.[N]
You did well. Killing Clanne...[AN]
[ML]
Who... of course. Alfonse of[N]
Askr. I've already driven[AN]
all Lythian forces off of Talis.[N]
Are you here for peace talks?[AN]
[MR]
I suppose you could say that.[N]
We're both men of peace. It's[AN]
such a shame Askr constantly[N]
gets involved in conflict...[AN]
[ML]
Well, what do you have to offer,[N]
your majesty? I know you had a[AN]
part to play in spiriting me away[N]
to Lythos originally.[AN]
[MR]
Are you suggesting you were abducted?[N]
I would never use such underhanded[AN]
tactics in a peace negotiation. I have[N]
a peace treaty drawn up right here.[AN]
Lythos will no longer interfere with[N]
the affairs of Aritia. You will be[AN]
free to go wherever you please. Now[N]
could you sign on the dotted line?[AN]
[ML]
While I don't doubt your good intent,[N]
I would like someone else to review[AN]
the contract in the interest of all[N]
things being in order here. Sheeda?[A]
[ML][MoveLeft][FFL][LoadSheeda][MoveFarLeft]
So you're King Alfonse of Askr? I am[N]
Empress Sheeda of Akaneia. It is a[AN]
pleasure to meet you. I, too, want[N]
nothing more than peace in the world.[A]
[MR]
So you are a woman of peace. It is a[N]
pleasure to meet you too. I am sure[AN]
you understand the urgency in signing[N]
this contract and bringing peace.[AN]
[FL]
Could you pass me the[N]
contract, please?[A]
[MR]
Of course. Just make it quick.[N]
Lythos needs this. ...And Aritia.[A]
[FL]
Hmm... Leaving Aritia alone means[N]
very little... What's this about[AN]
freedom of movement... Oh, what kind[N]
of contract is this meant to be?[AN]
"Marth Lowell may wander about freely[N]
when Divine One Alear is not in a[AN]
state of engagement with him"?[N]
What is this supposed to mean?[AN]
"This contract transfers control of[N]
the Empire of Akaneia to Kris of Sera[AN]
from Marth Lowell. The Lowells give up[N]
their claims to the throne"?[AN]
What kind of a peace treaty is this?[N]
This is a deed of surrender![AN]
"The marraige between Marth Lowell[N]
and Sheeda of Talis is officially[AN]
annulled. A wedding with Divine One[N]
Alear will happen at the earliest[AN]
convenience"?! I think I know who[N]
wrote this contract, but I'll go on...[AN]
"Marth Lowell and Chiki Narga will[N]
hereby become Emblems under the[AN]
control of Divine One Alear. Sheeda[N]
of Talis will be deprived of liberty"?![AN]
This has Alear's handiwork all over[N]
it! Marth! This contract is a trap.[AN]
Whatever you do, do not sign it![N]
Otherwise, Akaneia is doomed![AN]
[MR]
Grrr... Don't listen to her, Marth.[N]
Sign the contract, or else.[AN]
[Left]
And what if I don't sign this?[N]
What will you do then, Alfonse?[A]
[MR]
Well, there will be no peace if you[N]
don't sign this peace treaty.[AN]
I won't be able to speak for the[N]
safety of your sister...[AN]
[Left]
If I sign this, then Ellis will be[N]
safe. But if I don't sign this...[AN]
Then I'm a slave to Alear. As will[N]
Chiki. Sheeda will be her prisoner.[AN]
Akaneia as a whole will be Kris's.[N]
I can't sign this. Goodbye, Ellis.[AN]
[FL]
Oh, and the only way to cancel is[N]
by being "sent home" by a summoner?[AN]
Marth, here's the contract. Tear it[N]
up; this isn't a peace treaty![AN]
[MR]
Stop interfering in my negotiations.[N]
You aren't a party to these talks.[AN]
[Left]
Alfonse, you willingly handed that[N]
over to Sheeda. And I agree with[AN]
her assessment. This peace treaty[N]
isn't worth the paper it's written on.[AN]
[MR]
You... dare... tear up an Askran[N]
contract?! Mark my words, Lowells![AN]
You may have pushed out the Lythian[N]
ground invasion, but their fleet[AN]
is still poised to strike, with many[N]
reinforcements on board![AN]
In addition, Kris is now solidifying[N]
his rule of Akaneia. I can't speak[AN]
to how he plans to rule it, but he[N]
has little patience for dissent.[AN]
What options do you have? Alear[N]
wouldn't want you to wage war...[AN]
You could always flee. But Lythos[N]
has eyes everywhere... everywhere![A][X]

...Did I make the right choice? Ellis...[N]
Marich... Have I abandoned you?[AN]
[FL]
You've been through two full military[N]
campaigns, your majesty. There's no[AN]
perfect world where everything goes to[N]
plan. Sacrifices have to be made.[AN]
[Left]
...You're right, Rody. I hate to admit[N]
it, but you're right. Signing that[AN]
contract would have been the death of[N]
Akaneia as we know it today.[AN]
[Right]
That contract was rotten to the core.[N]
What I'm concerned about are the[AN]
"eyes of Lythos": what can Alear see?[N]
How much does she truly know?[AN]
[FR]
So what are we going to do? Are we[N]
going to live on Talis for a few[AN]
years? Didn't you do that when you[N]
were younger, Marth?[AN]
[Left]
That's not an option, Chiki. We only[N]
barely managed to slip past in the[AN]
evening twilight: once dawn breaks[N]
our ship is going to be sunk.[AN]
We need to make our escape tonight.[N]
Remember, Alear is still out there.[AN]
She only fled... was that a trap?[N]
She lured us in and now we're easy[AN]
pickings for the Lythian navy.[N]
But where do we escape to? There's[AN]
not a single region on the continent[N]
that isn't in some form of conflict.[AN]
[FL]
We still hold Garda. An option is[N]
to repeat the War of Darkness[AN]
and march for Orleans. We could[N]
try to sail for Peraty as well.[AN]
[Left]
Going to Peraty is useless without[N]
an army, and marching for Devil[AN]
Mountain would be highly predictable.[N]
That rules out the south and west...[AN]
[Right]
There's nothing but ocean beyond Talis[N]
for miles upon miles. Jugdral might[AN]
just be somewhere beyond those waves,[N]
but can we really risk everything on[AN]
an ancient rumour? There's really[N]
very little choice left to us...[A]
[FR]
I think the Ice Dragons' Temple is[N]
nearby if you just keep going[AN]
north from here. But we've almost[N]
no food. Can we make it there?[AN]
[Left]
Planning an escape is one thing,[N]
but I must also make plans for[AN]
the homecoming. Resistance to Kris[N]
must be kept up. Sir Rody?[AN]
[FL]
Yes, your majesty?[A]
[Left]
We're going to make a stop at Garda[N]
in order to drop you and its garrison[AN]
off. The garrison will continue to[N]
defend Garda, but you have orders.[AN]
You must reach Aritia by any means.[N]
If any escapees from Pales have[AN]
formed a resistance, join it. If not,[N]
Kain is in charge until I return.[AN]
Inform the people of Kris and Alear's[N]
lies without getting in trouble.[AN]
And beware Alfonse: any contract of[N]
his is nothing but trouble. Most[AN]
importantly: I am married to Sheeda.[N]
I have not abdicated the throne.[AN]
I am not residing in Lythos.[N]
As for any independence groups,[AN]
you should work with them. I'll[N]
negotiate when the war is won.[AN]
[FL]
If I may, where are you going?[N]
Should I tell anyone where?[AN]
[Left]
That... that is a secret. I don't[N]
want Kris to catch wind of my[AN]
flight. The knowledge that I live[N]
is all I'm willing to give.[AN]
[FL]
I understand, Emperor Marth. I will[N]
let you arrange your escape plans[AN]
with Empress Sheeda and Princess Chiki[N]
in private. May fortune favour you...[A][X]

[FR]
So where are we going, Marth?[N]
When will we be home again?[A]
[Left]
As you said earlier, due north.[N]
Anri's Way is a remote wasteland[AN]
and Alear is unlikely to know the[N]
Ice Dragons' Temple even exists.[AN]
But if that isn't safe, or if Great[N]
Sage Gato is not residing there...[AN]
then we have no choice but to sail[N]
east. The rumours say that we'll[AN]
either arrive in the kingdoms of[N]
Verdane or Agustria from here...[AN]
rumours I can't confirm. But they[N]
would be our only hope.[A]
[FR]
Gato? I hope he doesn't put us to[N]
sleep... Do you get nightmares?[AN]
[Left]
I... Hm...[N]
Well...[AN]
[Right]
The waters to the north are wild,[N]
and there is the occasional[AN]
pirate who'd try and raid the[N]
surrounding villages. Yet this[AN]
is what we have to do to survive.[N]
I just hope there's a harbour.[AN]
[Left]
That's a good point, Sheeda. What[N]
good would sheer cliffs be to us?[AN]
Still, we have no choice. We sail[N]
north, to the Ice Dragons' Temple.[A][X]
