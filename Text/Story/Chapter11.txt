## Ch11WorldMap
The joint attack of the Etrurian colonial[N]
faction and the Bernese rebels continue[AN]
to ravage Lycia. Every march in the kingdom[N]
summoned its full resources to fight.[AN]
[Event]
Lilina knew that if Ostia fell, the Kingdom[N]
of Lycia would soon follow.[AN]
[Event]
As such, the party rush to the gates of[N]
Ostia. Ostia is an ancient city, once[AN]
considered to be impossible to capture.[AN]
However, Roy proved this to be false during[N]
the Disturbance of Bern.[AN]
Yet the alliance against Lycia is an[N]
even greater threat than Zephiel's Bern.[AN]
[Event]
Etrurian forces loom from the west.[N]
Bernese soldiers stare from the east.[AN]
[Event]
And foreign Lythian forces threaten[N]
the main gate to the south.[AN]
Did the city of Ostia stand any hope of[N]
surviving this siege?[AN]
[Event]
The fate of Ostia is the fate of Lycia.[N]
Lilina resolves to defend her home...[A][X]

Identify yourself.[N]
[Right]
I am... Viscount Eldreed! Let me into[N]
Ostia as soon as possible![AN]

There is nobody with such a title.[N]
Entry is denied.[AN]
[Right]
No, I mispoke. I'm the Marquess[N]

[Right]
Password? Nobody said there'd be[N]
a password. It's... (Wrong answer)?[A]
[ML]
Incorrect. You are not who you say[N]
you are. Leave Ostia immediately.[AN]

[Right][LoadLilina][FR][LoadEliwood]
[Right]
The Queen of Lycia![A]
[FR]
Marquess Pherae![A]
[ML]
Her majesty shouldn't be here. The[N]
travel time between Pherae and[AN]
Ostia, factoring in the Laus crossing,[N]
means she should be two day's ride.[AN]

That is the password. My apologies,[N]
your majesty. Enter, quickly.[A][X]

## Ch11OpeningPolitics
[FL][LoadBarth][Left][LoadLilina][Right][LoadEliwood]
General Barth, how fares the siege?[N]
Do we have sufficient supplies?[AN]
[FL]
The situation is acceptable.[N]
Extra supplies are useful,[AN]
but Ostia should be able to[N]
hold out in a siege for[AN]
six months. The blockade[N]
only begun about a month ago.[AN]
[Left]
So we've five months left.[N]
Have you heard anything from[AN]
King Mordred or Prince Mildain?[N]
Is Etruria making any moves?[AN]
[FL]
Prince Mildain knows and is trying[N]
to defeat (Arcard Jr.)'s faction[AN]
internally within Etruria. That[N]
front is currently a stalemate.[AN]
[Right]
So (Arcard Jr.)'s faction can fight[N]
Etruria to a stalemate and besiege[AN]
Ostia at the same time. Rogue Bern[N]
is laying waste to the eastern[AN]
marches. And the mastermind is a[N]
dragon who kidnapped my son![AN]
General, do we have enough manpower[N]
to repel a direct assault?[AN]
[FL]
We can repel each faction individually.[N]
But united... I am not confident.[AN]
[Left]
That is concerning. General, we must[N]
rest for tonight. Tomorrow, we shall[AN]
begin planning how to survive this[N]
siege. We must prevail, for Lycia.[A][X]

## Ch11OpeningDiamantIsOutside
//The next morning...
[Left][LoadLilina][Right][LoadMarth][FR][LoadSheeda]
[Left]
Good morning, Lord Marth. The[N]
enemy commander is about to[AN]
issue demands, and one of them[N]
is your presence.[AN]
Bring a weapon: I have no intention[N]
of complying with any others.[AN]
[Right]
Of course. Thank you for the[N]
warning, Queen Lilina.[A]
[FR]
Marth, we should have everyone ready[N]
for combat. I'll go wake everyone[AN]
else up. You go listen to whatever[N]
outrageous demands Alear's man has.[A]
[Right]
Alright. When you're done, make your[N]
way to the battlements. I'll be with[AN]
the queen. Still, I lack the Falchion.[N]
What if Alear appears personally?[AN]
[Left]
During the Disturbance, I wielded the[N]
magic of Forblaze. But it's not my[AN]
personal property. It's kept in the[N]
Nabata Desert: it's not right to[AN]
involve Arcadia. We must buy time for[N]
preparations; let's go, Lord Marth.[A][X]

## Ch11OpeningDiamantDemands
[FL][LoadArcardJunior][Left][LoadDiamant][Right][LoadLilina][FR][LoadMarth]
[Left]
So you've all gathered here. Good.[N]
My name is Diamant, and I am the[AN]
King of Brodia. I am the leader of[N]
the Divine One's forces in Elibe.[AN]
I come here today to lay down the[N]
Divine One's demands for Lycia.[AN]
[Right]
King Diamant, what demands[N]
do you have to make?[AN]
[Left]
I suspect you are harbouring Marth[N]
Lowell and his companions.[AN]
The Divine One's first demand is[N]
that you return them all to her![AN]
[Right]
Absolutely not! Who I harbour in[N]
the Kingdom of Lycia is none of[AN]
your concern! Lord Marth and his[N]
friends are valuable allies.[AN]
I will not betray them to you.[N]
What is your next demand?[AN]
[FR]
Thank you, Queen Lilina.[N]
I will return this favour.[A]
[Left]
How about I let my friend, Lord[N]
(Arcard Jr.) make this demand?[AN]
[FL]
Queen Alear believes that Ostia is[N]
currently in unreliable hands.[AN]
And her fiance agrees with her.[N]
Ostia is to be surrendered to[AN]
the head of Etruria's colonial[N]
faction... me![AN]
[Right]
Ostia has been ruled by Roland's[N]
heirs for a millenium. I am[AN]
not going to end my family's[N]
legacy by handing over my[AN]
home to the leader of a foreign[N]
faction intent on conquest.[A]
[FL]
How dare you reject my demands![N]
I mean, the Divine One's demands.[AN]
Well Queen Alear finds your existence[N]
highly problematic, "Queen" Lilina![AN]
[Left]
Quiet! Lord (Arcard Jr.) has a rather[N]
loose tongue at times. The Divine[AN]
One's third demand is the removal of[N]
Lilina of Ostia from rule of Lycia.[AN]
The League of Lycia will select a[N]
new marquess to lead them.[AN]
[Right]
No.
[Left]
You should reconsider your rejection.[N]
If you accept, you can see Roy again.[AN]
[Right]
Roy... no. I don't believe you.[N]
I reject all of your demands.[AN]
[FL]
Stubborn brat! King Diamant will[N]
show you what awaits those who[AN]
defy the future ruling order of[N]
Elibe! Mark my words, Lilina![A]
[FR]
Diamant is a powerful warrior.[N]
Do not take him lightly.[AN]
[Left]
I had hoped we could talk this out.[N]
But I knew you'd refuse, Lilina.[AN]
(Arcard Jr.) spilt the beans, so[N]
I may as well spell things out.[AN]
Roy's with the Divine One in Lythos.[N]
But his power... Emblem, Engage![A]
//switch to engaged Diamant if art is available
//maybe use summon chant here and engage T1?
//rewrite as appropriate, maybe let Roy talk
[Right]
Roy! Is that you?[A]
[FR]
It is and it isn't. The process of[N]
engaging involves the Emblem's[AN]
soul being temporarily absorbed by[N]
the person using the Emblem Ring.[AN]
[Right]
So if we can take the ring, we can[N]
stop Roy's power from being drained?[AN]
[FL]
Diamant is a far stronger warrior[N]
than I am. You don't stand a chance[AN]
in defeating him. He knows techniques[N]
that I can't begin to understand![AN]
[Left]
I have the power of the Young Lion[N]
on my finger. In addition, I also[AN]
have this orb, granted by the Divine[N]
One to the monarchs of Elyos![AN]
[FR]
That's... No! That's... the Earth Orb![N]
If you have that, then... the Shield[AN]
of Seals must be broken! Why did you[N]
break the Shield?! Answer me![A]
[Left]
The Divine One knows of Artemis's[N]
Curse. If the Fire Emblem is[AN]
broken, then surely the curse will[N]
break along with it.[AN]
[FR]
That fool... Without the Shield of[N]
Seals, dragons the world over will[AN]
begin to degenerate. It must be[N]
reassembled.[A]
[Left]
So? The Divine One is above such[N]
things! The Orbs are much stronger[AN]
when they are separated from the[N]
Fire Emblem![AN]
[Right]
Degeneration? What does[N]
that mean?[A]
[FR]
In short, the process that turns the[N]
dragons from intelligent creatures[AN]
into wild beasts, capable only of[N]
destruction.[A]
[Right]
That's... I've never heard of[N]
any problems like that.[A]
[FR]
I'll give a detailed explanation[N]
later. Just know we must take[AN]
that green orb off of Diamant by[N]
any means necessary.[AN]
[Right]
And he's draining Roy's power using[N]
that ring on his finger.[AN]
[Left]
This parley is over. All units...[N]
Charge into Ostia! Break through[AN]
their defences, and capture Lilina[N]
of Ostia and Marth Lowell![A][X]

[ML]
Good work. Don't let them through.[N]
Everyone, we shall defend Ostia![AN]
In the name of the Kingdom of Lycia,[N]

## Ch11VillageText1
[MR][LoadCurrent][ML][LoadFace][0x01][0x01]
Oh, for peace to return to Elibe...[N]
Everything went to pieces when Roy[AN]
disappeared. I heard he was going to[N]
Pherae on business when he got[AN]
ambushed in Laus. And then he hasn't[N]
been seen since. And now it seems[AN]
everyone has something out for Lycia![N]
Here, take this. Bring us peace![A][X]

## Ch11VillageText2
[MR][LoadCurrent][ML][LoadFace][0x01][0x01]
I saw that (Arcard Jr.) this morning[N]
trying to worm his way inside.[AN]
Any of the queen's soldiers could[N]
easily kill him, if he would go[AN]
to the front lines! No, he's a[N]
pure coward, through and through.[AN]
Nail him down from afar with this,[N]
would you? We'd all thank you![A][X]

## Ch11VillageText3
[MR][LoadCurrent][ML][LoadFace][0x01][0x01]
So half of Bern want Guinevere gone.[N]
I am not even remotely surprised.[AN]
Then the old colonists in Etruria[N]
want to reconquer the Isles.[AN]
Influential, but not especially[N]
popular. But then I heard that[AN]
the colonial faction attacked a[N]
village in the Nabata Desert![AN]
I knew they were crazy, but that[N]
is completely irrational![AN]
Is somebody pulling the colonial[N]
faction's strings?[A][X]

## Ch11VillageText4
[MR][LoadCurrent][ML][LoadFace][0x01][0x01]
Psst... You're not with Lilina?[N]
Good. I don't like the way Lycia[AN]
is going. The marquesses are losing[N]
their power. The League is dead![AN]
Now it's a unitary kingdom. Let me[N]
tell you what I think. Eliwood of[AN]
Pherae was buddies with Hector.[N]
So if their kids got married,[AN]
the marches would merge. Caelin's[N]
already gone! Laus, Araphen,[AN]
Tania... maybe they should rebel![N]
Before Ostia gets them too![A][X]

## Ch11VillageText5
[MR][LoadCurrent][ML][LoadFace][0x01][0x01]
I know I didn't see him. But I swear[N]
Roy is leading the enemy army![AN]
Disappearing, turning into a ghost,[N]
fusing with that enemy commander...[AN]
This siege is driving me stir-crazy.[N]
I think it's some magic designed to[AN]
make Lilina doubt herself. Here, this[N]
should help remove any doubts.[A][X]

## Ch11VillageText6
[MR][LoadCurrent][ML][LoadFace][0x01][0x01]
Marquess Pherae has been searching[N]
for the king ever since he vanished.[AN]
I've heard a rumour that he found[N]
some dragons at the Dragons' Gate.[AN]
I've no evidence, but apparently he[N]
has quite some affinity for dragons.[AN]
Does he not know what Zephiel tried[N]
to do? Of course, it's a rumour.[AN]
I'm sure his wife just got ill.[N]
Marrying a dragon... Ha![A][X]

## Ch11VillageText7
[MR][LoadCurrent][ML][LoadFace][0x01][0x01]
Queen Lilina was always a friendly girl.[N]
Then her parents died at Araphen,[AN]
before getting captured in Legance's[N]
revolt. King Roy saved her then...[AN]
Oh, they were so happy after the war.[N]
They say he was snatched by people[AN]
from beyond Elibe. That "Brodia"[N]
the commander said he rules, maybe?[AN]
Either way, Lilina has a heavy burden.[N]
Use this to help relieve it.[A][X]

## Ch11VillageText8
[MR][LoadCurrent][ML][LoadFace][0x01][0x01]
You won't believe what I heard from[N]
one of these Lythian soldiers.[AN]
Zephiel was a dragon! Hartmut went[N]
and married a dragon behind everyone's[AN]
back. No wonder he wanted the dragons[N]
to rule: he is one! And Roy! He is[AN]
also a dragon! His mother was a dragon![N]
And then she brought friends to Lycia![AN]
I bet you Lilina's just a puppet of[N]
these dragons. Long live the Divine One![A][X]

## Ch11DiamantBurnItAllDown
[MR][LoadRoy][ML][LoadDiamant]
Roy, the Marquess of Laus wouldn't[N]
negotiate at all. This is the last[AN]
chance we'll get to chat before[N]
this battle gets underway.[AN]
[MR]
I was with the Divine One when you[N]
engaged. I'm still a bit dizzy.[AN]
So, Ostia's been occupied. Lycia[N]
cannot be misruled by an usurper.[AN]
King Diamant, let us liberate[N]
Ostia! For Lycia![AN]
[ML]
Yes, "liberate" Ostia. Of course.[N]
Emblem, Engage![AN]
[MR][Clear][ML]
//normal mug -> engaged mug
Hahaha... What Roy doesn't know[N]
can't hurt him. The Divine One's[AN]
orders are to raze Ostia to the[N]
ground! BLAZING LION![A][X]

## Ch11WhatTheHellDiamant
[MR][LoadLilina][Left][LoadMarth]
Diamant... he's set Ostia ablaze![N]
The Emblem Rings let their[AN]
wielder use an exceptionally[N]
powerful attack.[AN]
In my case, it was Star Rush,[N]
which just hit many times...[AN]
But Blazing Lion sets the[N]
battlefield - Ostia - on fire![AN]
[MR]
How dare that Diamant try to[N]
burn Ostia to the ground...[AN]
The fire hasn't spread too[N]
far yet. But there are embers[AN]
everywhere. Whatever you do,[N]

## Ch11TheSideGatesFall
[ML][LoadMarth][MR][LoadFace][0x01][0x01]
The side gates have been breached![N]
The enemy is swarming in.[AN]
We'll try to hold them off here,[N]

we'll last. Maybe going for the[N]
commander might help us...[A][X]

## Ch11AlearArrives
[ML][LoadDiamant][MR][LoadAlear]
King Diamant, hello. How fares[N]
the battle for Ostia?[AN]
[ML]
It's going excellently, Divine[N]
One. I've set Ostia aflame[AN]
as you ordered. The gates have[N]
all been broken, but resistance[AN]
continues in the streets. The[N]
castle should soon fall.[AN]
[MR]
Diamant! Did I not order you to[N]
lead the charge into Ostia?[AN]
Why are you sitting back at[N]
the entrance?![AN]
[ML]
I had a scare with Emblem Roy[N]
and feared a defection--[AN]
[MR]
Orders are orders! Still, if we[N]
win this battle I'll forgive you.[AN]
Charge directly into Ostia Castle,[N]
and capture Lilina and Marth![A]

soon as I possibly can.[AN][Clear]

myself.[A][X]

[Right]
The Emblem Shield! Champion's[N]

breaking the Fire Emblem would[AN]
end up breaking the curse.[N]
It's also stronger seperated.[AN]

soon change...[AN]
[FL]
What are you talking about?[N]
I can't hear you.[A]
[Left]
Chiki, I think... something[N]
terrible happened somewhere.[AN]
And we're going to have to[N]
make things better.[AN]
[FL]
You don't mean I'll have to[N]
be put to sleep again?[AN]
Please, don't! I don't want[N]
to be alone with Gato again![A]
[Left]
Shh... I will never let that[N]
happen to you. Don't worry.[A]
[Right][LoadSheeda]
There's a knight on horseback[N]
coming our way.[AN]
I think he's being chased down.[N]
It could be Eliwood...[AN]
[FR][LoadEliwood]
Ah, you made it. We have no time.[N]
Alear wounded us, and Barth...[AN]
I don't think he made it. We need[N]
to hide in this cave![A][X]

Divine One, this maze is too[N]
complicated! I'm lost![A]
[Left]
Yes... There are so many different[N]
routes through this cave.[AN]
I hear that a Divine Weapon rests[N]
somewhere within this cave.[AN]
Framme, the ground there is glowing.[N]
Does the Durandal lie there?[AN]
[FL]
Excellent observation, Divine One![N]
Let me stand right here... Aah![AN]
It burns! This is a trap! Ouch![N]
Please put this fire out![AN]

//There's more to Askr than Alfonse: let Veronica appear here
[Right]
Alear, there you are. Ostia has[N]
fallen, I see. And with it, Lycia.[AN]
You really have destablised Elibe.[N]
All so you can keep Roy onside...[AN]
[Left]
Gathering three armies to break[N]
Ostia worked wonderfully.[AN]
My work here is almost done. All[N]
that's left is sealing this cave.[AN]
[FR]
With your dearly beloved Marth[N]
starving to death inside?[AN]
Are you sure that's a good idea?[N]
Shouldn't you search the cave?[AN]
[FL]
How dare you criticise the Divine[N]
One! If she wants to seal off[AN]
this cave, she will! We can get[N]
the missing Emblems back later.[AN]
[Left]
Something about Elibe never felt[N]
right to me. Nabata's okay, but[AN]
the rest of it messes with me.[N]
Alfonse, I got told Roy's contract[AN]
might be null and void. Could you[N]
check the details to be sure?[AN]
[Right]
We can do that at your base.[N]
By the way, congratulations on[AN]
your success in Valencia.[AN]
[Left]
It's great seeing another Emblem[N]
in physical form once again![AN]
I've just got to check up on[N]
someone in the Somniel, and[AN]
we'll be back with you soon.[AN]
[FR]
Don't take too long.[A][X]


## Ch11EndingWeGotRoysRing
[FL][LoadEliwood][Right][LoadLilina]
So, this is the ring Diamant[N]
was wearing. The source of[AN]
his power, and a drain on[N]
Roy's... Is this true?[AN]
Diamant said these words...[N]
(Emblem Summon Chant!)[A]
[Left][LoadRoy]
...So we've lost. The last thing[N]
I remember was Diamant engaging[AN]
with me. Then we disengaged as[N]
the ring was pulled off him...[AN]
[FL]
Roy, do you not recognise us[N]
at all? I'm your father![AN]
[Right]
Look into my eyes! Roy,[N]
please! I'm your wife![AN]
[Left]
Father? Wife? I know Alear wanted[N]
to marry me soon, and my father[AN]
is dead. You must be lying...[A]
[FL]
Roy, I'm right here! How could[N]
you think I'm dead?! You've[AN]
been lied to, my son! Your[N]
memories have been altered![AN]
[Left]
The Divine One said the Marquess[N]
of Laus has been ruining Lycia.[AN]
Yet Diamant kept looking away[N]
from her when we engaged...[AN]
[Right]
Alear didn't want you looking at[N]
me, so Diamant looked away.[AN]
Please! We're the rulers of Lycia,[N]
not Marquess Laus![AN]
[Left]
This goes against everything[N]
I've heard since I left Elibe.[AN]
[FL]
What has that woman done to you?[N]
If Hector saw us now...[AN]
[Left]
Why would he care? My father is[N]
dead, and he died childless.[AN]
But now that I say that, that[N]
sounds so... wrong...[AN]
[Right]
I think I understand. Alear must[N]
have cast some magic supressing[AN]
memory of anyone she considers[N]
to be inconvenient...[AN]
I think Roy needs a reminder of[N]
just who exactly we are...[AN]
[FL]
I am your father, Eliwood![N]
Marquess of Pherae![A]
[Right]
My name is Lilina. I'm the[N]
daughter of Hector and Lyndis,[AN]
Queen of Lycia, Marquess of[N]
Ostia, and your wife![A]
[Left]
Father... Wife... Lil...ina...[N]
So familiar... Lilina![AN]
Father! I remember everything![N]
Oh, I'm so glad to see you![AN]
That Alear, she's found some[N]
way to temporarily seperate my[AN]
soul from my body so her lackeys[N]
can use me as a power source.[AN]
[Right]
Roy! You're yourself again![N]
I have so much to tell you.[AN]
[FL]
Roy! Tell me, just where are[N]
you? Physically, that is.[AN]
[Left]
Father, it started over a year[N]
ago. I was on my way to Pherae[AN]
as part of my duties when I[N]
suddenly got ambushed in Laus.[AN]
This man - I learned his name[N]
was Alfonse later - threatened[AN]
me into signing some contract.[N]
I'd have been shot by a hooded[AN]
man and set upon by Alfonse's[N]
crooks if I refused. I don't[AN]
exactly remember the details,[N]
but I do remember "Emblem"[AN]
coming up, along with handing[N]
Lycia over to Alear...[AN]
[Right]
Roy... Once you disappeared, I[N]
ruled Lycia by myself. Soon[AN]
afterwards, anger started to[N]
run through Bern...[AN]
They considered Guinevere an[N]
usurper, imposed by you.[AN]
Arcard's son stirred things[N]
up in Etruria over the[AN]
Western Isles and how you[N]
liberated them.[AN]
The common factor appeared to[N]
be their disdain of you.[AN]
And without you, they believed[N]
that I would be weak.[AN]
[Left]
Lilina, don't let them get you[N]
down. You're not weak.[A]
[Right]
//I don't think we need to see Lilina recapping on-screen stuff
Thanks. Things got a lot worse[N]
about three months ago?[A][X]

[Right]
...And that's how we ended[N]
up in this situation. Ouch...[A]
[Left]
Lilina... I can't do anything[N]
to help you from here. Alear's[AN]
going to reunite my body and soul[N]
soon, and won't let them split[AN]
so long as you have that ring.[N]
Keep it with you: I won't fuse[AN]
with your soul or anything, but[N]
it might prove to be useful.[AN]
[FL]
We can't just hide with the[N]
Durandal forever. We don't[AN]
have much food. We need to[N]
escape somewhere...[AN]
[Right]
We could flee to Ilia. King[N]
Zealot has no major enemies.[AN]
[FL]
Etruria is close, though we'd[N]
have to cross (Arcard Jr.)'s[AN]
territory... too dangerous.[A]
[Left]
My mind is clear again. Alear[N]
won't rest until you're dead.[AN]
Lilina, Father... You need to[N]
get out of here. Leave Elibe.[AN]
[Right]
Leave Elibe? ...And then what?[N]
What'll happen to Lycia?[AN]
[Left]
Nothing good, but what can we[N]
do? At best, Alear has her[AN]
"reliable partners": the colonial[N]
faction turning Lycia into a[AN]
colony of Etruria. At worst, there[N]
won't be a Lycia at all...[AN]
If Alear catches you... I'm not[N]
sure if becoming an Emblem is[AN]
better or worse than being[N]
directly executed.[A]
[FL]
The thought of it makes me sick...[N]
But is there no other way?[AN]
Roy, where outside of Elibe should[N]
we go?[A]
[Left]
I hear footsteps. I don't have long.[N]
Get to Badon as quickly as you can.[AN]
Commandeer a ship and evacuate![N]
I wouldn't trust the Dragons' Gate.[AN]
Instead, you should sail past the[N]
Isles, then...[A]
[FFL][Invert]
(Roy Emblem Chant)[Invert][A]
[Left]
Lilina, Father... We will[N]
see each--[A][Clear]
[Right]
And he's gone. The Durandal[N]
may just be our only hope.[AN]
[FL]
I never thought I would have[N]
to wield the Blazing Sword[AN]
once again. But it must be[N]
done. Roland, we must use[AN]
your sword once again.[N]
Elibe depends on it.[A][X]
