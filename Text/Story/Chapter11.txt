## Ch11WorldMap
The joint attack of the Etrurian colonial[N]
faction and the Bernese rebels continue[AN]
to ravage Lycia. Every march in the kingdom[N]
summoned its full resources to fight.[AN]
Lilina knew that if Ostia fell, the Kingdom[N]
of Lycia would soon follow.[AN]
As such, the party rush to the gates of[N]
Ostia. Ostia is an ancient city, once[AN]
considered to be impossible to capture.[AN]
However, Roy proved this to be false during[N]
the Disturbance of Bern.[AN]
Yet the alliance against Lycia is an[N]
even greater threat than Zephiel's Bern.[AN]
Etrurian forces loom from the west.[N]
Bernese soldiers stare from the east.[AN]
And foreign Lythian forces threaten[N]
the main gate to the south.[AN]
Did the city of Ostia stand any hope of[N]
surviving this siege?[AN]
The fate of Ostia is the fate of Lycia.[N]
Lilina resolves to defend her home...[A][X]

[ML]
//Let's have Arcardo Jr. pull this one
Identify yourself.[N]
[Right]
I am... Viscount Eldreed! Let me into[N]
Ostia as soon as possible![AN]
[ML]
There is nobody with such a title.[N]
Entry is denied.[AN]
[Right]
No, I mispoke. I'm the Marquess[N]
of Tania! Bern ruined everything![AN]
[ML]
Say the password.[A]
[Right]
Password? Nobody said there'd be[N]
a password. It's... (Wrong answer)?[A]
[ML]
Incorrect. You are not who you say[N]
you are. Leave Ostia immediately.[AN]
[Right]
Argh...[A][Clear]
[ML]
The amount of enemy spies trying[N]
to enter continues to grow.[AN]
Halt! Who goes there?[A]
[Right][LoadLilina][FR][LoadEliwood]
[Right]
The Queen of Lycia![A]
[FR]
Marquess Pherae![A]
[ML]
Her majesty shouldn't be here. The[N]
travel time between Pherae and[AN]
Ostia, factoring in the Laus crossing,[N]
means she should be two day's ride.[AN]
[Right]
The password is (Right answer)! We came[N]
as fast as we possibly could![AN]
[ML]
That is the password. My apologies,[N]
your majesty. Enter, quickly.[A][X]

## Ch11OpeningPolitics
[FL][LoadBarth][Left][LoadLilina][Right][LoadEliwood]
General Barth, how fares the siege?[N]
Do we have sufficient supplies?[AN]
[FL]
The situation is acceptable.[N]
Extra supplies are useful,[AN]
but Ostia should be able to[N]
hold out in a siege for[AN]
six months. The blockade[N]
only begun about a month ago.[AN]
[Left]
So we've five months left.[N]
Have you heard anything from[AN]
King Mordred or Prince Mildain?[N]
Is Etruria making any moves?[AN]
[FL]
Prince Mildain knows and is trying[N]
to defeat (Arcard Jr.)'s faction[AN]
internally within Etruria. That[N]
front is currently a stalemate.[AN]
[Right]
So (Arcard Jr.)'s faction can fight[N]
Etruria to a stalemate and besiege[AN]
Ostia at the same time. Rogue Bern[N]
is laying waste to the eastern[AN]
marches. And the mastermind is a[N]
dragon who kidnapped my son![AN]
General, do we have enough manpower[N]
to repel a direct assault?[AN]
[FL]
We can repel each faction individually.[N]
But united... I am not confident.[AN]
[Left]
That is concerning. General, we must[N]
rest for tonight. Tomorrow, we shall[AN]
begin planning how to survive this[N]
siege. We must prevail, for Lycia.[A][X]

## Ch11OpeningDiamantIsOutside
//The next morning...
[Left][LoadLilina][Right][LoadMarth][FR][LoadSheeda]
[Left]
Good morning, Lord Marth. The[N]
enemy commander is about to[AN]
issue demands, and one of them[N]
is your presence.[AN]
Bring a weapon: I have no intention[N]
of complying with any others.[AN]
[Right]
Of course. Thank you for the[N]
warning, Queen Lilina.[A]
[FR]
Marth, we should have everyone ready[N]
for combat. I'll go wake everyone[AN]
else up. You go listen to whatever[N]
outrageous demands Alear's man has.[A]
[Right]
Alright. When you're done, make your[N]
way to the battlements. I'll be with[AN]
the queen. Still, I lack the Falchion.[N]
What if Alear appears personally?[AN]
[Left]
During the Disturbance, I wielded the[N]
magic of Forblaze. But it's not my[AN]
tome to wield. We must buy time for[N]
preparations; let's go, Lord Marth.[A][X]

## Ch11OpeningDiamantDemands
[FL][LoadArcardJunior][Left][LoadDiamant][Right][LoadLilina][FR][LoadMarth]
[Left]
So you've all gathered here. Good.[N]
My name is Diamant, and I am the[AN]
King of Brodia. I am the leader of[N]
the Divine One's forces in Elibe.[AN]
I come here today to lay down the[N]
Divine One's demands for Lycia.[AN]
[Right]
King Diamant, what demands[N]
do you have to make?[AN]
[Left]
I suspect you are harbouring Marth[N]
Lowell and his companions.[AN]
The Divine One's first demand is[N]
that you return them all to her![AN]
[Right]
Absolutely not! Who I harbour in[N]
the Kingdom of Lycia is none of[AN]
your concern! Lord Marth and his[N]
friends are valuable allies.[AN]
I will not betray them to you.[N]
What is your next demand?[AN]
[FR]
Thank you, Queen Lilina.[N]
I will return this favour.[A]
[Left]
How about I let my friend, Lord[N]
(Arcard Jr.) make this demand?[AN]
[FL]
Queen Alear believes that Ostia is[N]
currently in unreliable hands.[AN]
And her fiance agrees with her.[N]
Ostia is to be surrendered to[AN]
the head of Etruria's colonial[N]
faction... me![AN]
[Right]
Ostia has been ruled by Roland's[N]
heirs for a millenium. I am[AN]
not going to end my family's[N]
legacy by handing over my[AN]
home to the leader of a foreign[N]
faction intent on conquest.[A]
[FL]
How dare you reject my demands![N]
I mean, the Divine One's demands.[AN]
Well Queen Alear finds your existence[N]
highly problematic, "Queen" Lilina![AN]
[Left]
Quiet! Lord (Arcard Jr.) has a rather[N]
loose tongue at times. The Divine[AN]
One's third demand is the removal of[N]
Lilina of Ostia from rule of Lycia.[AN]
The League of Lycia will select a[N]
new marquess to lead them.[AN]
[Right]
No.
[Left]
You should reconsider your rejection.[N]
If you accept, you can see Roy again.[AN]
[Right]
Roy... no. I don't believe you.[N]
I reject all of your demands.[AN]
[FL]
Stubborn brat! King Diamant will[N]
show you what awaits those who[AN]
defy the future ruling order of[N]
Elibe! Mark my words, Lilina![A]
[FR]
Diamant is a powerful warrior.[N]
Do not take him lightly.[AN]
[Left]
I had hoped we could talk this out.[N]
But I knew you'd refuse, Lilina.[AN]
(Arcard Jr.) spilt the beans, so[N]
I may as well spell things out.[AN]
Roy's with the Divine One in Lythos.[N]
But his power... Emblem, Engage![A]
//switch to engaged Diamant if art is available
[Right]
Roy! Is that you?[A]
[FR]
It is and it isn't. The process of[N]
engaging involves the Emblem's[AN]
soul being temporarily absorbed by[N]
the person using the Emblem Ring.[AN]
[Right]
So if we can take the ring, we can[N]
stop Roy's power from being drained?[AN]
[FL]
Diamant is a far stronger warrior[N]
than I am. You don't stand a chance[AN]
in defeating him. He knows techniques[N]
that I can't begin to understand![AN]
[Left]
I have the power of the Young Lion[N]
on my finger. In addition, I also[AN]
have this orb, granted by the Divine[N]
One to the monarchs of Elyos![AN]
[FR]
That's... No! That's... the Earth Orb![N]
If you have that, then... the Shield[AN]
of Seals must be broken! Why did you[N]
break the Shield?! Answer me![A]
[Left]
The Divine One knows of Artemis's[N]
Curse. If the Fire Emblem is[AN]
broken, then surely the curse will[N]
break along with it.[AN]
[FR]
That fool... Without the Shield of[N]
Seals, dragons the world over will[AN]
begin to degenerate. It must be[N]
reassembled.[A]
[Left]
So? The Divine One is above such[N]
things! The Orbs are much stronger[AN]
when they are separated from the[N]
Fire Emblem![AN]
[Right]
Degeneration? What does[N]
that mean?[A]
[FR]
In short, the process that turns the[N]
dragons from intelligent creatures[AN]
into wild beasts, capable only of[N]
destruction.[A]
[Right]
That's... I've never heard of[N]
any problems like that.[A]
[FR]
I'll give a detailed explanation[N]
later. Just know we must take[AN]
that green orb off of Diamant by[N]
any means necessary.[AN]
[Right]
And he's draining Roy's power using[N]
that ring on his finger.[AN]
[Left]
This parley is over. All units...[N]
Charge into Ostia! Break through[AN]
their defences, and capture Lilina[N]
of Ostia and Marth Lowell![A][X]
