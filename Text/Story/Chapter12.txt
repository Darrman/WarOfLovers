## Ch12WorldMap
//I do wonder: is it possible to have conditional world map narration?
//Would be a lot neater to explicitly mention Roy, etc.
Ostia has fallen, and the Kingdom of Lycia[N]
with it. As the inferno burnt itself out,[AN]
the people of Ostia woke up to the prospect[N]
of rule by a colonial governor in place of[AN]
their native monarch. Lilina and the surviving[N]
defenders of Ostia found themselves hiding[AN]
in the Durandal cave, where the spirit of[N]
Roland is said to haunt its walls.[AN]
Nowhere on Elibe was truly safe from Lythos[N]
and its proxy forces in Bern and Etruria.[AN]
The only way out was by sea. Lycia's largest[N]
port, Badon, was the logical target.[AN]
However, Badon is under direct Lythian control,[N]
and the city was placed under a blockade.[AN]
Inaction would have fatal consequences: the[N]
destruction of the Shield of Seals would[AN]
herald the end of the dragons, Chiki included.[N]
But before making good their escape from[AN]
Elibe, the army first had to break out from[N]
the Durandal cave...[A][X]

## Ch12OpeningExplainingTheEscape
[Left][LoadChiki][FL][LoadLilina]
And the exit should be right[N]
around this corner.[AN]
...It's been blocked off.[N]
We're trapped! Alear's[AN]
sealed us inside of this[N]
cave! This is the only exit.[A]
[Left]
Lilina, I've got an idea![A]
[FL]
What is it?[A]
[Left]
If I transform, I might be[N]
able to destroy these rocks![A]
[FL]
...Don't let yourself be seen.[AN]
A lot of people don't like[N]
the dragons at all.[A]
[Left][MoveRight]
GRRR... GRARGH![A]
..Daylight... Don't feel good...[N]
So dizzy...[A]
[FL]
Come on, hold my hand. Fa never[N]
had any dizzy spells after she[AN]
untransformed... Are the dragons[N]
on Akaneia different somehow?[AN]
[Right]
Fa? Who's she?[A]
[FL]
She's a dragon like you. You're[N]
quite similar, but she lives[AN]
very far away and we need to get[N]
out of here as fast as we can.[A][X]

Prince Alcryst, Sir Vander is at[N]
the town gates. He has a message.[AN]
[ML]
Why did the Divine One think I am[N]
worthy of guarding this port?[AN]
I already failed to find any[N]
evidence of Emblem Lyn.[AN]
[MR]
You are not worthless. Please[N]
stop putting yourself down.[AN]
[ML]
But you're wrong! I'm sure[N]
Vander is going to fire me.[A]
[MR][MoveRight][FR][LoadVander]
It is an honour, King Alcryst.[N]
King Diamant fell in battle.[AN]
[ML]
...Diamant... dead? Me... king?[N]
No, no, no, no, no! It should[AN]
have been me! I should have[N]
been the one to die! Diamant[AN]
should have had a long and[N]
prosperous reign! Not... this![AN]
What will the people of Brodia[N]
think of ME as the KING?![AN]
[FR]
Your highness, please calm down.[N]
The Divine One witnessed his[AN]
demise. Rest assured that Diamant[N]
died an honourable death.[AN]
She is currently hunting down the[N]
enemy officers that slew him.[AN]
[ML]
Sniff... It should have been[N]
me... Waaah! Waaah! Waaah![AN]
[FR]
You have my sympathies. Of course,[N]
your coronation must happen,[AN]
but it can wait a few weeks.[N]
I'm almost certain Ostia has[AN]
been captured, and our ultimate[N]
goal in Lycia achieved.[AN]
[ML]
Even in death, Diamant is achieving[N]
more than I am in life...[AN]
I can't even find a single person.[N]
I'm a terrible warrior.[AN]

The Divine One's orders still stand:[N]
do not let anybody into Badon.[AN][X]

Did you hear the news? The new[N]
Marquess Ostia is the head of[AN]
the League of Lycia! Some things[N]
never change, do they?[AN]
[ML]
All the new marquesses are either[N]
colonists or Divine One worshippers![AN]
This League isn't like the original.[N]
We're just puppets! (Arcard Jr.)[AN]
is calling all the shots! I know[N]
a conspiracy when I see one.[AN]
[MR]
Shut up! Arcard Jr's taking a far[N]
harsher stance on any criticism[AN]
than Lilina ever did. I've heard[N]
rumours that Roy disappearing[AN]
is part of some prophecy of the[N]
Divine One people.[AN]
[ML]
That he's an "Emblem", and he's[N]
engaged to their god?[AN]
And the Lythian army just appearing[N]
to support rebels and topple[AN]
Lilina? I'm very suspicious. I'm[N]
loyal to the old regime![AN]
[MR]
What did I tell you?! There's a[N]
guard coming this way![A]
[FL][LoadFace][0x01][0x01]
//if I make Alcryst's goon a character the same guy
What's this about the old regime?[N]
I'll have you know that any[AN]
positive discussion of the[N]
Kingdom of Lycia is a crime.[AN]
Lilina of Ostia and Eliwood of[N]
Pherae are wanted fugitives.[AN]
There's a bounty on their heads,[N]
dead or alive.[A]
[ML]
Shame on you! Traitor to Lycia![N]
To hell with that "Divine One",[AN]
Saint Elimine wouldn't tolerate[N]
any of the nonsense--[AN]

You're under arrest for blasphemy[N]
and treason. Away with you![A][X]

## Ch12OpeningHowDoWeEscape
[FL][LoadEliwood][Left][LoadLilina][Right][LoadMarth][FR][LoadSheeda][Right]
Port Badon once again. It was a[N]
lively city the last time[AN]
I was here. Now it's crawling[N]
with occupation troops.[AN]
[FR]
Are there any side gates?[N]
Flying down the main road[AN]
is only going to get us[N]
seen.[AN]
[FL]
This is the only gate. It's possible[N]
to fly over the walls, but I[AN]
wouldn't recommend it. It's far too[N]
slow a method of getting in.[AN]
Nobody's seen us yet, but I have[N]
no doubt elite enemies are nearby.[AN]
[Right]
What are the chances of us finding[N]
any help inside Badon?[AN]
[FL]
I've found aid here before. But[N]
the likes of Fargus have long[AN]
since retired. We've no choice[N]
but to man a ship ourselves.[AN]
I acquired a vessel searching[N]
for Roy. If Arcard Jr.'s[AN]
minions haven't seized it, it[N]
should be at the docks.[AN]
[Left]
The sun's setting. I have no doubt[N]
that extra guards will be on duty.[AN]
There is no safe way of entering[N]
Badon, I fear.[A]
[Right]
We won't be able to see anything[N]
in the nighttime darkness.[AN]
But if we take our time, we will[N]
certainly be surrounded.[AN]
We should prepare for battle[N]
before we're seen.[A][X]

## Ch12AfterPrepEscapeRules
[MR][LoadMarth]
Our plan is set: we're going to[N]
run through Badon as fast as[AN]
we can until we reach Eliwood's[N]
ship. When I embark, we go![AN]
All units, please board before[N]
me, or you may be left behind,[AN]
and that is the last thing I[N]
want to happen to anybody.[A][X]

## Ch12WhoAreThesePeople

Tonight seems like a good[N]
night for a nice walk.[AN]
[MR][LoadChiki]
Tired... Must not be seen...[N]
Must get to the ship...[AN]
[ML]
Wait a minute... That's Emblem[N]
Chiki, isn't she? Well, she[AN]
would be if Emblem Marth didn't[N]
set her free...[AN]
I'll see if she'll say anything[N]
more before raising the alarm.[A]
[MR]
Elibe makes me so tired even[N]
without running away...[AN]
What if Gato comes to put me[N]
to sleep again?[AN]
Worse... what if I turn wild?[N]
I don't think Marth is[AN]
telling me everything.[N]
I'll have to ask him...[A]

Shh! We haven't been seen yet.[N]
I know you're tired, Chiki...[A]

## Ch12YourMajestyLilinaHasArrived
[ML][LoadAlcryst][MR][LoadFace][0x01][0x01]
Your majesty, we are under attack.[N]
Lilina's trying to escape.[AN]
I saw her at the edge of town talking[N]
to the would-be Emblem Chiki.[AN]
[ML]
We must secure the harbour. The[N]
ballisticians here are excellent.[AN]
Our allies have a brigade based[N]
just outside the port:[AN]
the alarm must be raised. How long[N]
will they take to arrive?[AN]
[MR]
Your majesty, it will likely[N]
take a few hours. I'm certain[AN]
Emblem Marth is in the party.[N]
No matter what, I will protect you.[AN]
[ML]
Lapis, that's what I should do.[N]
Citrinne, Diamant... I failed.[AN]
I can't lose you too. That would[N]
just be proof of how unfair[AN]
this world is. I hope the Divine[N]
One is nearby.[AN]
[MR]
None of us can send her a[N]
telepathic message.[AN]
But if she's on the Somniel,[N]
maybe she might land here...[A]
[ML]
I'm not worthy of this position.[N]
This ring may be devoid of any[AN]
spirit. But Emblem Lyn's power[N]
still courses through this ring.[AN]
I may not be worthy of using[N]
Astra Storm, but this ballista[AN]
can at least serve as a poor man's[N]
imitation of the attack...[AN]
We cannot allow the fugitives to[N]
reach these ships![A]

I'll cover you from close range.[N]
Together, nothing can stop us![A][X]

## Ch12HouseText2
[ML][LoadFace][0x01][0x01][MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML]
We give our all to defeat Bern,[N]
and now half of Lycia's occupied[AN]
by Bern's rebels. Not Bern proper.[N]
Just its rebels! Why bother?[AN]
We may as well have just surrendered[N]
to Zephiel: it would have saved[AN]
us a lot of bloodshed compared to[N]
falling to his loyalist officers.[A][X]

## Ch12HouseText3
[ML][LoadFace][0x01][0x01][MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML]
I haven't been outside of Badon[N]
for a while - the reasons should[AN]
be fairly obvious. I've heard[N]
that some of the knights of[AN]
Pherae have started a gureilla[N]
campaign against the enemy.[AN]
I fear for them: Queen Guinevere[N]
is not sending any troops[AN]
across the border to fight, and[N]
I'm not sure if that Mordred[AN]
has raised a finger against[N]
Arcard Jr. after Ostia fell![A][X]

## Ch12HouseText4

I never said this, but I hope[N]
...let's say Marquess Ostia[AN]

of Lycia to fight another day.[A][X]

## Ch12HouseText5
[ML][LoadFace][0x01][0x01][MR][LoadCurrent]

Word going around is that Ostia's[N]
been taken over by an Etrurian[AN]
crook. Son of Arcard - an evil man.[N]
He enslaved the people of the Isles[AN]
and worked them to death.[N]
Roy put an end to all of that misery,[AN]
but he may as well be dead too.[N]
Did the apple fall far from the tree?[AN]
Will we too be enslaved? Here, take[N]
this: you deserve it far more.[A][X]

## Ch12HouseText6
[ML][LoadFace][0x01][0x01][MR][LoadCurrent]
There's so many strange goings-on[N]
lately. Marquess Pherae finds[AN]
dragons. The queen allies with[N]
them to fight the colonists.[AN]
Then they all go to Bern and[N]
we get invaded by rebels.[AN]
Now Ostia has fallen and we[N]

apparently Queen Lilina was[N]

During the fall of Ostia, Diamant[N]

The Shield of Seals? The Sword of[N]
Seals is the strongest weapon[AN]
on Elibe. Is the Shield related[N]
to it at all?[AN]
[Right]
I wouldn't know for sure. The Shield[N]
of Seals was created many years[AN]

At first they became infertile, and[N]
then they slowly started going insane...[AN]

Roy could never have been born![AN]
But Nergal was human, so Ninian was[N]

Terrible indeed, Lilina. The[N]
Shield of Seals served two[AN]
purposes: halt any further[N]
degeneration, and seal away[AN]
the Earth Dragons. But sealing[N]
away a dragon's true nature[AN]
into a stone and living as a[N]
human was also required.[AN]
The Earth Dragons were too[N]
proud and refused to become[AN]
Mamkutes, with one exception.[N]
Dark Dragon Mediuth...[AN]
[Left]
In some ways, this sounds similar[N]
to the Scouring and Ending Winter...[AN]
Humans and dragons used to live[N]
in peace together. Then humanity[AN]
shattered that peace. The war[N]
went back and forth for some time,[AN]
but eventually the Divine Weapons[N]
were created.[AN]
[FL]
They still exist today: Durandal[N]
is one of eight.[AN]
[Left]
The magic of Forblaze is another.[AN]
In combination with the power of the[N]
dragons, the Divine Weapons ended up[AN]
releasing so much energy that nature[N]
started collapsing in on itself.[AN]
The Ending Winter... Natural disasters[N]
were a frequent occurence.[A]
[Right]
Nothing that catastrophic happened[N]
in Akaneia. What then?[A]
[Left]
The dragons could no longer keep[N]
dragon form for any extended[AN]
period of time, and took on human[N]
form to conserve energy.[AN]
Mankind soon won the Scouring and[N]
almost completely banished the[AN]
dragons from Elibe. Only one small[N]
pocket of them remained.[A]
[Right]
And the survivors must have fled[N]
through the Dragons' Gate.[AN]
On Akaneia, the Divine Dragons[N]
fought the degenerated Earth[AN]
Dragons. They won, but at the[N]
cost of wiping themselves out.[AN]
Only three remain, and I know[N]
them all personally.[AN]
Centuries later, Adrah the thief[N]
broke the Shield, sold the orbs,[AN]
and founded Akaneia. The seal[N]
slowly decayed until I restored[AN]
the Shield about six years ago.[N]
But if it's broken again...[AN]
The Earth Dragons were about to[N]
break free from their prison.[AN]
I doubt the seal will hold long.[N]
And degeneration will resume.[A][X]

[FL][LoadEliwood][Left][LoadLilina][Right][LoadMarth][FR][LoadChiki]
Marth, Sheeda said you had something[N]
very important to tell me.[A]
[Right]
...She's right. I can't keep you[N]
in the dark about this.[AN]
Chiki, Alear broke the Shield of[N]
Seals. I have the Earth Orb[AN]
here with me. That means... that[N]
means degeneration...[AN]
[FR]
No... I'll turn into a wild dragon?[N]
I'll start attacking humans?[AN]
Please, Marth... Don't let this[N]
happen to me... Save me...[A]
[Right]
I won't let that happen. I swear[N]
on my life, I will protect you.[AN]
We will fix the Shield of Seals.[N]
We will stop Alear's plans.[AN]
You will not be put to sleep.[N]
And you will not become wild.[A]
[FR]
Promise? You have to promise.[N]
How long do we have?[AN]
[Right]
I... don't know how long we[N]
have. I'm sorry.[AN]
You look more awake, at least.[N]
I think Elibe's air wasn't[AN]
doing you any favours at all.[N]
Did the Ending Winter warp[AN]
Elibe so badly that it broke the[N]
Shield of Seals' protection?[AN]
[FR]
Will we be on this ship for long?[N]
Where are we going?[AN]
[FL]
We're going wherever the winds[N]
take us. We've got a few months[AN]
worth of food. Let's not think[N]
about the rest. We will find land.[AN]
Wherever that land may be, I do[N]
not know.[A][X]
