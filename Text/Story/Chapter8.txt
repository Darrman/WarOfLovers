## Ch8WorldMap
Marth's party crosses the Dragons' Gate and[N]
steps foot on the continent of Elibe.[AN]
[Event]
A millenium after the Scouring, the war that[N]
drove the dragons from Elibe, King Zephiel[AN]
of Bern sought to reverse humanity's victory[N]
and return the continent to the dragons.[AN]
However, many opposed him, led by Roy of Pherae.[N]
[Event]
Roy's army pushed Zephiel back to Bern,[AN]
putting a halt to his ambitions.[AN]
Roy's own ideals were that human and dragon[N]
could live in peace together.[AN]
[Event]
Zephiel's sister, Guinevere,[Event] was crowned Queen[N]
of Bern in the aftermath of what would be[AN]
known as the Disturbance of Bern.[AN]
[Event]
Meanwhile, Roy soon married Lilina of Ostia,[N]
[Event]
his childhood friend, and the couple became the[AN]
first monarchs of a united Kingdom of Lycia.[AN]
It appeared Elibe was at the dawn of an era of[N]
peace. But this hope would swiftly be crushed.[AN]
Two years after Guinevere's coronation, Roy[N]
disappeared without a trace.[AN]
[Event]
Suspicion fell on almost every country, but no[N]
conclusive proof was forthcoming.[AN]
[Event]
Instability festered throughout Elibe.[N]
Many were disloyal to Guinevere's regime.[AN]
Neighbouring Etruria, an ally to Roy in the[AN]
Disturbance, has elements believe it got a raw[N]
deal. Despite being war enemies, they have[AN]
common cause: they dislike the rise of Lycia.[N]
[Event]
With Eliwood discovering Marth crossing the[AN]
Dragons' Gate,[Event] a new element has entered Elibe.[N]
He escorts the Akaneians to meet with Lilina.[AN]
[Event]
Marth, Sheeda, and Chiki wonder what they must[N]
do on this unknown continent...[A][X]

## Ch8OpeningLanding
[ML][LoadEliwood][MR][LoadMarth]
[ML]
We've arrived in Lycia. This is the[N]
port of Badon. Ostia is a few days'[AN]
ride to the west.[A]
[MR]
Is the road to Ostia known to[N]
be dangerous in any way?[AN]
[ML]
We'll be passing through the march[N]
of Laus, whose loyalty to the rest[AN]
of Lycia is questionable at best.[N]
But our group is small. We won't be[AN]
there long, and we have escorts.[AN]
[MR]
Well, that's good. Eliwood, could[N]
you tell me about Elibe?[AN]
[ML]
Hmm... There's a lot to go over, but[N]
we have time on the road. Ask away.[AN]
[MR]
Where do I begin... We're going to Ostia[N]
to meet her, so I'll start here.[AN]
What kind of person is Queen Lilina?[A][X]

## Ch8OpeningMeetingEntrance
[ML][LoadBarth][Right][LoadEliwood][FR][LoadMarth]
So, this is Ostia. Whoever built this[N]
castle was a great architect.[AN]
[Right]
Indeed. Ostia Castle stood untaken[N]
for almost a thousand years.[AN]
[ML]
Halt. State your name and purpose.[N]
Unauthorised entry is prohibited.[AN]
[FR]
My name is Marth Lowell.[N]
I'm here to meet Queen Lilina.[A]
[ML]
A likely story. Many have used[N]
such an excuse, and many more[AN]
will try to. I suggest you leave.[N]
Ostia does not need troublemakers.[AN]
[Right]
General Barth, I have personally[N]
invited Marth and his companions[AN]
to meet Queen Lilina. Please let[N]
us through.[AN]
[ML]
Identify yourself.[A]
[Right]
Eliwood, Marquess of Pherae.[A]
[ML]
If you are the Marquess,[N]
say the password.[A]
[Right]
Vortex of Strategy.[AN]
//Eliwood (1)8 is The Dread Isle - we've just been there.
//Lyn 8 it is - it's hack 8 after all.
//Or "craven cur"
[ML]
Very well. Marquess Pherae, who[N]
will visit her majesty?[AN]
[Right]
Myself and my three[N]
companions.[AN]
[ML]
Marquess Pherae and Mr. Lowell have[N]
already identified themselves.[AN]
State your name, woman in red.[AN]
[FR][Clear][LoadSheeda]
Sheeda Lowell.[A]
[ML]
Very well, Mrs. Lowell. Girl in[N]
pink, state your name.[AN]
[FR][Clear][LoadChiki]
Um... My name's Chiki.[A]
[ML]
Is that all?[A]
[FR]
Um... I'm... of the[N]
Narga tribe?[AN]
[ML]
Miss Narga it is, then.[N]
You may all enter.[AN]
[Right]
Thank you, General Barth.[N]
Marth, I'll go on ahead.[A][X]

## Ch8OpeningMeetingEliwoodLilina
[FL][LoadEliwood][Left][LoadLilina]
[Left]
Eliwood, you're back. I see you[N]
still haven't found Roy yet...[AN]
[FL]
I'm afraid not, Lilina. But when[N]
I searched the Dread Isle, I[AN]
met people who crossed through[N]
the Dragons' Gate.[AN]
I've brought them here with me.[N]
Perhaps they may hold a clue[AN]
as to what happened to Roy.[N]
He's been gone for a year...[AN]
[Left]
It hurts me as much as it hurts[N]
you. Now, about your guests.[AN]
If they passed through the Gate,[N]
does that mean dragons are[AN]
returning to Elibe once again?[N]
I can only hope for peace.[AN]
[FL]
One of them does claim to be[N]
a Divine Dragon. Of course,[AN]
proving it would be ill-advised.[N]
We aren't in the majority.[AN]
[Left]
It's sad, isn't it? Another[N]
thing to blame Zephiel for.[AN]
He fought to return Elibe to[N]
the dragons. Most of them[AN]
are completely innocent, but[N]
all most people think of are[AN]
Zephiel's war dragons. Not[N]
many are like you, Eliwood.[A]
[FL]
Haha... I wish Ninian was still[N]
with us. But there's no point[AN]
in dwelling on the past. I can[N]
only hope she's smiling on me.[AN]
[Left]
Well, for her sake, we have to[N]
find Roy. Let's meet our guests.[A][X]

## Ch8OpeningMeetingProper
[FL][LoadEliwood][Left][LoadLilina][Right][LoadMarth][FR][LoadSheeda]
[Left]
Greetings, my guests. I am Lilina,[N]
Queen of Lycia and Marquess Ostia.[AN]
It is an honour to meet you all.[N]
My friend Marquess Pherae invited[AN]
the three of you to meet with me,[N]
and I am more than happy to oblige.[AN]
[Right]
It is an honour to meet you,[N]
your majesty. My name is[AN]
Marth Lowell, and I come from[N]
...the Kingdom of Aritia.[AN]
[Left]
With all due respect, Mr. Lowell,[N]
I have never heard of Aritia.[AN]
[FR]
Your majesty, I am Sheeda, Marth's[N]
wife. Allow me to explain how[AN]
we got here, to the best of my[N]
ability.[AN]
[Left]
Go on.[A]
[FR]
Thank you, your majesty. Aritia,[N]
along with Talis - home - and[AN]
several others were formed into[N]
the Empire of Akaneia, which[AN]
occupies most of the continent[N]
that shares its name.[AN]
A civil war has broken out, and[N]
we had to flee the new regime.[AN]
We got shipwrecked and found a[N]
gate that leads to Valour.[AN]
From there, we found Marquess[N]
Pherae searching for his son,[AN]
your husband. I apologise for[N]
our ignorance. We in Akaneia[AN]
have no knowledge of Elibe.[N]
May you please educate us?[AN]
[Left]
It would be my pleasure. Do you[N]
know of the Disturbance of Bern?[AN]
[Right]
Marquess Pherae informed us of it,[N]
but not of any current affairs.[AN]
[Left]
Very well. The current issues stem[N]
from the disappearance of the king.[AN]
Roy, King Roy's disappearance a year[N]
ago has led to instability all over.[AN]
To the west of Lycia is Etruria.[N]
Prince Mildain was an ally of Roy's[AN]
in the Disturbance, but many nobles[N]
joined Bern. The most relevant to[AN]
the current situation is Lord Arcard,[N]
who operated a colonial mining[AN]
operation. King Roy dismantled the[N]
Etrurian colonies and gave the[AN]
Western Isles their independence.[N]
But the apple did not fall far[AN]
from the tree. The children want[N]
to resume their fathers' empire.[AN]
[Right]
How great of a threat are they?[A]
[Left]
A rapidly growing one. Their position[N]
has little popular support, but[AN]
some wealthy benefactors have begun[N]
pouring money into that faction.[AN]
It has reached the point where they[N]
frequently raid the Lycian border.[AN]
Marth, I would like you to accompany[N]
the border patrol for a time.[AN]
I would much rather trust you on your[N]
word, but times are dangerous.[AN]
Please, prove your sincerity. You're[N]
not the first mysterious stranger.[AN]
[FR]
I have no evidence, but I do think[N]
Lilina is a sincere woman.[AN]
She strikes me as someone you'd[N]
want as a friend. We should go.[AN]
[Right]
Very well, your majesty. I accept[N]
your offer. Where is the patrol?[AN]
[Left]
Ostia is not far from Etruria. The[N]
border is within a day's ride.[AN]
Do not worry. Marquess Pherae will[N]
accompany you. If everything goes[AN]
well, you should see no combat.[N]
Please, everyone, stay safe.[A][X]

## Ch8OpeningAtTheBorder
[ML][LoadEliwood][MR][LoadMarth]
[ML]
We've made it. Etruria controls[N]
everything beyond the river.[AN]
Right now, the colonial faction[N]
is passive, but there is often[AN]
little warning as to when they[N]
attack.[AN]
[MR]
You say the Etrurian prince is an[N]
ally of Roy's. Why isn't he doing[AN]
anything to stop this faction[N]
raiding Lycia?[AN]
[ML]
The affairs of the Etrurian court[N]
are always complicated. It would[AN]
not surprise me if King Mordred[N]
was unaware of these raids.[AN][X]

## Ch8OpeningEngageTaunt
[ML][LoadArcardJunior][MR][LoadAmber]
//placeholders, replace with boss and head of the colonials
//mostly focus on Brodians since Diamant is arc villain
//Let's go with Amber here
[ML]
//colonial
So, you're the head of one of the[N]
new units? Excellent.[AN]
[MR]
You must be Arcard, then. I am[N]
Amber, retainer to King Diamant.[AN]
He tells me that you've been[N]
wronged by the Lycians.[AN]
[ML]
Wronged is putting it lightly. My[N]
family had owned the Western Isles[AN]
for generations. Its mineral wealth[N]
alone made us fabulously rich.[AN]
Unfortunately, the isles are infested[N]
with bandits. My father requested[AN]
Roy of Pherae to clean them up.[N]
But did he keep to his word? No![AN]
Instead, he joined the bandits,[N]
overthrew my father, and created[AN]
a new country run by the bandits.[N]
And now I'm wasting away in poverty.[AN]
[MR]
Roy? So this is what he used to do?[N]
The Divine One speaks well of him.[AN]
[ML]
Divine One? If this is your way of[N]
referring to Saint Elimine, then[AN]
she'd have no patience for him.[N]
His list of crimes is long indeed.[AN]
[MR]
Oh, my apologies. I was under the[N]
impression he was a great legend.[AN]
[ML]
Prince Mildain might tell you that,[N]
but he was in on Roy's betrayal.[AN]
It's strange that he's disappeared,[N]
but that will make crushing the[AN]
Lycian upstarts easier. Amber, you[N]
say your king wants that pathetic[AN]
loser Lilina off the throne of Lycia.[N]
Well, on that we agree. I'd love[AN]
to take Roy's head, but his wife's[N]
head will make a fine trophy too.[AN]
And Lilina was also a part of Roy's[N]
insurrection. Hahaha... Amber,[AN]
the Lycian border is right across[N]
the river. Today, the war begins![AN]
[MR]
Indeed! Arcard, your name will live[N]
on as one of Elibe's finest legends![AN]
Lycia will fall! Lilina will fall![N]
Long live Lord Arcard![A][X]

## Ch8AfterPrepGood
[FL][LoadFace][0x6A][0x01][Right][LoadEliwood]
//soldier
[FL]
Lord Eliwood, we're under attack.[N]
Arcard Jr's launched a raid, and[AN]
this raid is far bigger than any[N]
of his previous attacks.[AN]
[Right]
At least we made it before the attack.[N]
Troops, prepare a counter-attack![A][X]

## Ch8AfterPrepBad
[ML][LoadAmber]
//Amber
This may well be the beginning of a[N]
new legend. His majesty and the[AN]
Divine One are relying on me to[N]
break into Lycia. From there, we[AN]
cross the mountains and charge[N]
head-first to Ostia![A][X]

## Ch8House1
[ML][LoadFace][0x60][0x1][MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML]
Lycia may be united now, but will[N]
it ever be free from conflict?[AN]
King Roy rose up and defeated[N]
Zephiel and company during the[AN]
Disturbance of Bern, and then he[N]
suddenly disappears. Why?[AN]
The Etrurian nobles across the[N]
river only started their raids[AN]
after Roy fell off the face of[N]
the earth. I suspect them![A][X]

## Ch8House2
[ML][LoadFace][0x60][0x1][MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML]
This area is a major crossing point[N]
between Lycia and Etruria. Ostia is[AN]
a short distance to the east. Aquleia[N]
is still several weeks ride away.[AN]
This used to be a peaceful area, but[N]
Arcard Jr. just keeps attacking.[AN]
Sooner or later he's going to launch[N]
a full invasion of Lycia.[A][X]

## Ch8House3
[ML][LoadFace][0x60][0x1][MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML]
Now I'm not a student of history, but I[N]
always found it unusual Ostia is the[AN]
centre of power in Lycia. It's so close[N]
to the western border Etruria could[AN]
overrun it whenever it pleases. Laus[N]
is centrally located, which would[AN]
shorten communication times across[N]
the league. But I suppose Roland[AN]
hailed from Ostia himself, and none[N]
of his descendants were inclined[AN]
to move the court. I suppose that's[N]
the least of Lilina's worries now![A][X]

## Ch8House4
[ML][LoadFace][0x60][0x1][MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML]
To say Arcard was a piece of work is[N]
an understatement. When he wasn't[AN]
exploiting the people of the Western[N]
Isles to line his filthy pockets,[AN]
he was betraying Etruria's interests[N]
to Bern. His son isn't much better.[AN]
Roy destroyed the mining operation[N]
he was due to inherit, and has held[AN]
a grudge against him ever since. But[N]
Roy's gone now. He can't get revenge.[A][X]

## Ch8House5
[ML][LoadFace][0x60][0x1][MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML]
I couldn't tell you where that knight[N]
hails from, but he appears to know[AN]
Arcard's benefactors. He seems a bit[N]
pompous, always chasing legends.[AN]
Our Eight Legends are long dead.[N]
He certainly won't find Saint Elimine.[AN]
Though I get the idea he isn't even[N]
Elibian - I don't know who the "Divine[AN]
One" is meant to be, and neither do I[N]
know what an "alpaca" is meant to be![A][X]

## Ch8House6
[ML][LoadFace][0x60][0x1][MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML]
The Lycians' treatment of Arcard is[N]
despicable. Roy should remember[AN]
that without Etrurian assistance,[N]
Narshen would have ground Ostia[AN]
into dust. Then Roartz and Arcard[N]
send Roy to clean up the mines[AN]
in compensation for relieving[N]
Ostia, only for him to turn around[AN]
and join a rebellion against us![N]
Now the Western Isles are gone,[AN]
and nobody bats an eye about it![N]
Roy may well have disappeared, but[AN]
the damage is still done. I hope[N]
Arcard makes his woman pay![A][X]

## Ch8Village1
//Secret Book or a skill scroll
[ML][LoadFace][0x60][0x1][MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML]
You're with the Lycian Army, aren't[N]
you? Oh, we're saved. That crooked[AN]
Junior launched an attack above and[N]
beyond his typical raids. I'd say[AN]
if it weren't for your patrol, he'd[N]
be at the walls of Ostia by sundown![AN]
Roy disappearing... Colonial aggression...[N]
Troubling rumours from Bern...[AN]
These times are dangerous. No wonder[N]
people call Elibe the "Dark Continent"[AN]
sometimes... Oh, here's something for[N]
your trouble. Give it a read sometime.[A][X]

## Ch8Village2
//White Gem
[ML][LoadFace][0x60][0x1][MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML]
Arcard Junior's greed is endless. King[N]
Mordred wouldn't approve of retaking[AN]
the Isles. And when Prince Mildain[N]
takes the throne, he definitely would[AN]
not approve a reconquest. What makes[N]
him think attacking Lycia, an allied[AN]
country, is going to make anything[N]
better at all? He pleads poverty, but[AN]
still has spectacular wealth from[N]
his father's mines, powered by slave[AN]
labour. Like father, like son. Junior[N]
left this behind him here one day.[AN]
I think you'd use this for the good[N]
of us all. May Lilina persevere.[A][X]

[FL]
I have never seen an attack of such[N]
scale launched here before.[AN]
Arcard Junior's colonial faction is[N]
growing more and more powerful.[AN]
If we hadn't arrived here when we did,[N]
the border would have been overrun.[AN]
Marth, you have my thanks.[A]
[Right]
Thank you, Eliwood. I can't help but[N]
notice we crossed over the river[AN]
while we fought that attack off.[N]
Is Etruria going to respond?[AN]
[FL]
Not without hearing our side of the[N]
story. Etruria is not known for[AN]
rushing into actions without giving[N]
them thought first.[A]
[Right]
This is good to know. Eliwood,[N]
I think I have an idea who the[AN]
enemy commander was. Explaining[N]
this is going to take a while.[AN]
[Left]
Do you think he knows[N]
Alear, Marth?[AN]
[FL]
Chiki, who's Alear?[A]
[Left]
She's really mean. She took Marth[N]
away to Lythos a few years ago![AN]
But then he managed to escape.[N]
She had me captured too...[AN]
But then Marth saved me before[N]
Alear could make me an Emblem.[AN]
[FL]
Alear? Lythos? Emblem?[N]
Is Lythos on Akaneia?[AN]
[FR]
As Marth says, it's a long[N]
story. We don't know much[AN]
about Alear. It's probably[N]
best to explain the details[AN]
to Queen Lilina as well. It's[N]
a very long story.[AN]
[FL]
Very well. This fort is secure.[N]
We'll spend the night here,[AN]
and return to Ostia first thing[N]
tomorrow morning.[AN]

Alright. Good night, Sheeda.[N]
Tomorrow's going to be long.[A][X]

Hello, Diamant. So, the Elibe plan has[N]
started. Was your battle victorious?[AN]
[Right]
It was a military defeat, but I have[N]
faith that it is the first domino.[AN]
Soon, Lycia will fall. Elibe will[N]
know the glory of the Divine One.[AN]
This battle may have cost me a[N]
retainer, which is disappointing.[AN]
But the might of Brodia will always[N]
be with you, Divine One.[AN]
[FL]
The might of Elyos must be as one[N]
in order to unite all Twelve[AN]
Emblems in physical form here once[N]
more. I believe Elibe has two.[AN]
King Diamant, what is the status[N]
of the search for Lyndis?[AN]
[Right]
Lyndis? Of course. Alcryst is[N]
currently searching Elibe for[AN]
her, but a long time has passed[N]
since her Emblem appearance.[AN]
She'd be about fourty years old.[N]
We know nothing about anything[AN]
she did during the Disturbance of[N]
Bern. Is she even alive?[AN]
[Left]
I hope she's alive! I want all[N]
twelve of the Emblems right[AN]
next to me, in physical form![N]
Even if Marth is dead...[AN]
Alfonse did say death is a trifle,[N]
but... reviving him? Corrupting him?[AN]
[FL]
If I may interrupt, Divine One,[N]
isn't there something you[AN]
need to inform King Diamant about[N]
regarding your new boyfriend?[AN]
[Left]
Oh, silly me. Veyle told me I had[N]
to move on from Marth, so I did.[AN]
Diamant, I've been dating Emblem[N]
Roy after I heard of Marth's demise.[AN]
Oh, here he comes. This is good[N]
timing. Diamant, make room for him.[A]
[Right][MoveFarRight][FFR][LoadRoy][MoveRight]

Hello, Alear. How are you doing?[N]
Hello as well, Diamant. It's[AN]
been a few days. It seems I'm[N]

[Left]
Ah. Diamant is going to war in Elibe[N]
soon, and will need to engage.[AN]
I'd like to test if your spirit can[N]
engage with Diamant in his war[AN]
while your body stays here with me.[N]
It's the best of both worlds.[AN]
[FR]
Interesting. So long as I can still[N]
unleash Blazing Lion on my foes,[AN]
then I see no problem with this[N]
plan. I approve, Divine One.[A]
[Left]
Great. So, what's step two of your[N]
plan to kill-- I mean defeat the[AN]
villains currently occupying the[N]
throne of Lycia currently?[AN]
[Right]
There's someone occupying Lycia's[N]
throne? I was under the impression[AN]
it was vacant. Lord Hector was killed[N]
by Zephiel, and my father succumbed[AN]
to his illness. Who occupied Hector's[N]
throne? I feel like I should know.[AN]
[Left]
Well, Laus is known for its power[N]
grabs. With Pherae and Ostia out[AN]
of commission, Laus is the most[N]
prominent march. We want Lycia in[AN]
good hands. We've been working with[N]
reliable partners for this.[AN]
[Right]
This makes me glad. I do love[N]
you, Alear. When are we getting[AN]
married? I know it's been quick,[N]
but if something goes wrong,[AN]
I'd like to have no regrets.[AN]
[Left]
Let's not rush things. The[N]
last wedding was a disaster.[AN]
Marth escaped once the thought[N]
of Sheeda came to his mind.[AN]
The last thing I need is for[N]
you to remember Lil--[AN]
[FL]
Divine One! We haven't checked[N]
if mentioning that name is[AN]
safe around Roy yet! We need[N]
to test the loophole closure[AN]
in a safe environment. I do[N]
apologise for the interruption.[A]
[Right]
Who are you all talking about?[N]

[Left]
I was thinking of an experiment.[N]
I'll tell you the results later.[AN]
Diamant, you're free to go now.[N]
Good luck in your campaign.[AN]
You can do it, and overthrow[N]
"Laus" for Lycia's sake![A]
