//Marth:
Sheeda, how do you fare?[A]
//Sheeda:
[MR]
Quite well Marth, although[N]
I could do without being[AN]
dragged into a third war.[A]
[ML]
//Marth:
I know, this entire situation confuses[N]
me greatly. Who is this Alear anyway?[AN]
Her followers claim she is a Divine[N]
Dragon, but aren't Chiki, Gato, and[AN]
Chainy supposed to be the last of those?[A]
[MR]
//Sheeda:
I don't know about that.[N]
The lore of the Dragon Tribes was[AN]
never something I needed to study[N]
back in Talis.[AN]
What I do know is she took you[N]
away from me. I will never[AN]
forgive her for that![A]
[ML]
//Marth:
Mmm, I sure wouldn't want be Alear[N]
when the time comes. Few out there[AN]
can withstand your Wing Spear.[A]
[MR]
//Sheeda:
You're no slouch yourself Marth.[N]
It can't be easy to break free[AN]
of mind control only to be thrust[N]
into another war.[A]
[ML]
//Marth:
It's not, but so long as I have you[N]
at my side Sheeda, I can handle[AN]
anything. I love you Sheeda.[A]
[MR]
//Sheeda:
And I love you Marth.[A][X]

//Sheeda:
Marth, what's wrong?[A]
//Marth:
[ML]
Oh Sheeda, I was just thinking of the[N]
time I spent held captive by Alear.[AN]
I can't help but feel her followers[N]
aren't all bad people.[AN]
//(If Celine has been recruited include "akin to Celine", if not leave it out but include the rest of the sentence)
Surely there are more good people[N]
in her forces who[AN]
see this is wrong, so why are they[N]
forcing the fight? Surely they[AN]
would not be doing all this without[N]
some greater intention?[AN]
//Sheeda:
[MR]
Marth... Regardless of their intentions,[N]
they kidnapped you and tried to force[AN]
you, a married man, into a marriage with[N]
someone else. These same forces have[AN]
been complicit in kidnapping heroes from[N]
across the planet. No matter their[AN]
intentions, their actions are evil,[N]
and they must be stopped.[AN]
//Marth:
[ML]
Yes, I agree. Their ends, whatever they[N]
may be, do not justify the means,[AN]
but are we really any better? We are[N]
also summoning people from who knows[AN]
where to fight our war. Even if our[N]
actions are in self defense, can we[AN]
truly say we are any more justified[N]
in our actions?[A]
//Sheeda:
[MR]
I don't know the answer to your question[N]
Marth, but what I do know is if we did[AN]
not fight on their terms, I would lose[N]
you, and you are absolutely worth[AN]
fighting for. If fighting this enemy[N]
means stooping to their level, then[AN]
I will do so without hesitation.[A]
//Marth:
[ML]
You're right Sheeda, no matter[N]
the cost, fighting for our[AN]
happiness is worth fighting for.[A][X]

//Marth:
Sheeda, it is good[N]
to see you well.[AN]
//Sheeda:
[MR]
Marth, it is good to see you as well.[N]
Do you remember what today is?[AN]
//Marth:
[ML]
Of course I do, it's the anniversary[N]
of the day we met. I remember it well.[AN]
In fact, it is why I'm here. The[N]
battlefield may be no place to[AN]
celebrate an anniversary, but like we[N]
always have, we'll make the best[AN]
of it! Which is why I want you to[N]
have this Sheeda.[AN]
//Sheeda:
[MR]
Oh Marth, what a beautiful hairpin![N]
It's such a cute little pegasus![AN]
//Marth:
[ML]
I know it's not much given the[N]
circumstances, but I hope this[AN]
shows how much I still love you[N]
Sheeda. No matter what cruel[AN]
tricks the world throws at us.[N]
My love for you is true, and[AN]
the likes of Alear will never[N]
change that.[AN]
//Sheeda:
[MR]
Oh thank you Marth. I love you too.[N]
Meeting you taught me just how[AN]
important love is, and losing you,[N]
temporary as it was, nearly broke me.[AN]
//Marth:
[ML]
Sheeda... I vow on this sword, I[N]
will never again leave your side.[AN]
//Sheeda:
[MR]
And I will never leave yours.[N]
I love you Marth.[AN]
//Marth:
[ML]
And I love you Sheeda.[A][X]
