//Chiki:
Mar-Mar! Mar-Mar![A]
//Marth:
[ML]
What is it, Chiki?[A]
//Chiki:
[MR]
Look at this! I finally[N]
made them right![AN]
//Marth:
[ML]
Ah yes, this apple has been baked[N]
to perfection. Has Sheeda been[AN]
giving you cooking tips?[A]
//Chiki:
[MR]
Mmhmm. I've been working very hard[N]
on this recipe. Ban-ban used to[AN]
make these for me all the time,[N]
so I just had to learn how to[AN]
make them myself![A]
//Marth:
[ML]
But of course! Why don't you go and make[N]
some more and we can eat them together.[AN]
//Chiki:
[MR]
Really? Yay! I'm going to go make[N]
the best baked apples you've ever[AN]
seen Mar-Mar![A]
//(Chiki leaves)
//Marth:
[ML]
Such a sweet child...[N]
It's hard to believe she's possibly[AN]
the most dangerous being on this[N]
planet. Even still, I must protect[AN]
her. Purity like Chiki's must be[N]
protected.[A][X]

Chiki.
//Chiki:
[MR]
What is it, Mar-mar?[A]
//Marth:
[ML]
Maybe you shouldn't[N]
fight anymore.[A]
//Chiki:
[MR]
What, are you saying I'm not helping[N]
anymore? But I want to help![AN]
//Marth:
[ML]
No Chiki, you're a great help,[N]
it's just...[AN]
//Chiki:
[MR]
It's just what?[A]
//Marth:
[ML]
I promised to keep you safe,[N]
and with the Shield of Seals[AN]
broken, I'm afraid.[A]
//Chiki:
[MR]
So you'll fix the Shield.[N]
You've done it before with[AN]
my help, we can do it again,[N]
but I have to help![A]
//Marth:
[ML]
But Chiki, do you not still have the[N]
nightmares? I'm certain the constant[AN]
fighting isn't helping. Please Chiki,[N]
you should stay at camp. Let me and[AN]
Sheeda handle the fighting. You should[N]
rest and focus on keeping the[AN]
degeneration at bay.[A]
//Chiki:
[MR]
NO! I won't fall asleep again.[N]
Mar-mar, how could you even[AN]
suggest such a thing?![A]
//(Chiki storms off)
//Marth:
[ML]
Chiki...[A][X]

[ML]
Chiki, I'm sorry about before.[N]
It was quite harsh of me to[AN]
suggest going back to sleep.[N]
Even still I worry for you.[AN]
How are you feeling?[A]
//Chiki:
[MR]
Better now, thanks to you apologizing.[N]
Still I have good days and bad days.[AN]
Some days I terrified I'll become the[N]
monster in my nightmares, we must[AN]
restore the shield as soon as we can![A]
//Marth:
[ML]
I know Chiki, and forgive me for[N]
suggesting you aren't helping.[AN]
You are a huge help, without you we[N]
would have never gotten this far.[AN]
//Chiki:
[MR]
So then... Why did you[N]
try to push me away?[AN]
//Marth:
[ML]
To be honest with you,[N]
I was afraid.[AN]
//Chiki:
[MR]
You? Afraid?[N]
I don't believe it.[A]
//Marth:
[ML]
Yes, greatly afraid. You're like[N]
a daughter to me Chiki, and if[AN]
something were to happen to you,[N]
it would break me inside,[AN]
so please be careful, and don't[N]
take unneccesary risks. I know[AN]
you are powerful, but as Mar-mar,[N]
please be careful for me?[AN]
//Chiki:
[MR]
I understand, I'll do that![A][X]
