[MR]
Oh Lord Eliwood. I meant to ask how[N]
you were holding up, especially so[AN]
soon after recovering from your[N]
illness.[AN]
//Eliwood:
[ML]
Well, the grave hasn't found me yet.[N]
Besides, even if illness still was[AN]
taking me, nothing would keep me out[N]
of this fight. Roy needs our help.[AN]
//Lilina:
[MR]
Yeah... Say, Lord Eliwood, how do[N]
you think Roy is faring?[AN]
//Eliwood:
[ML]
You should know as well as I what Roy[N]
lacks in physical strength, he makes[AN]
up for in will. He won't give in.[AN]
//Lilina:
[MR]
B-but, according to Lord Marth, Alear[N]
is somehow able to twist the truth[AN]
to make her "Emblems" believe objective[N]
lies like Marth loving Alear. It was[AN]
only Marth's love for Sheeda that[N]
allowed him to break free and-[AN]
//Eliwood:
[ML]
Then you have nothing to fear[N]
do you, or are saying Roy's[AN]
love for you is not true?[AN]
//Lilina:
[MR]
Lord Eliwood...[A][X]

//Lilina:
[MR]
Lord Eliwood, you were childhood[N]
friends with my father correct?[AN]
//Eliwood:
[ML]
But of course Lilina, me and Hector[N]
were nearly inseparable during our[AN]
youth. Why, we never would've met[N]
our wives if we did not go on that[AN]
journey to find my father together.[AN]
//Lilina:
[MR]
Huh, I never knew my father met my[N]
mother along you meeting Roy's mother.[AN]
//Eliwood:
[ML]
Yes, in many ways our fates were[N]
linked, but why do you ask about[AN]
him Lilina?[A]
//Lilina:
[MR]
I was wondering, do you know any ways[N]
I could channel my father's strength.[AN]
He always seemed so certain, so[N]
committed to what he thought was right,[AN]
and I... even in a cause as just as ours,[N]
I doubt what we're doing is right.[AN]
//Eliwood:
[ML]
True, I question the ethics of where[N]
some of our soldiers come from,[AN]
but Lord Marth and his companions seem[N]
like good comrades, and if we didn't[AN]
stand up to the Elyosians, who knows[N]
what would become of Elibe?[AN]
//Lilina:
[MR]
Everything you've said is true[N]
and yet... Roy was my anchor[AN]
during the Disturbance of Bern.[N]
Without him I... I just don't know.[AN]

//Lilina:
[MR]
Lord Eliwood, what do you need?[A]
//Eliwood:
[ML]
I am so proud of you.[A]
//Lilina:
[MR]
Huh?! Where did that come from?[A]
//Eliwood:
[ML]
You've faced your doubts and found[N]
your answer to the problem you were[AN]
facing our last conversation correct?[AN]
//Lilina:
[MR]
Well... Yes. I may lack the confidence[N]
of my father, but the more I thought[AN]
about it, the more I realised that[N]
even without Roy, I'm not without an[AN]
anchor, I have you, I have all of our[N]
comrades. Whenever I doubt myself,[AN]
I can rely on their strength, and while[N]
none of you individually can reach the[AN]
connection I have with Roy, you all[N]
give me the strength to keep fighting.[AN]
As such, no matter what happens, I[N]
will keep fighting until Roy is safe[AN]
from all who would harm him![A]
//Eliwood:
[ML]
That's exactly how Hector maintained[N]
his strength. You're more like your[AN]
father than you realise, Lilina.[A]
//Lilina:
[MR]
Huh?! I'm nothing like my father,[N]
stop teasing me Lord Eliwood.[AN]
//Eliwood:
[ML]
This isn't a jest, Hector fought like[N]
a monster on the battlefield, 'tis[AN]
true, but his strength came from his[N]
companions, and his need to protect[AN]
them. Hector never fought for himself,[N]
only to protect those he loved, which[AN]
is exactly where you are now drawing[N]
your strength from.[AN]
//Lilina:
[MR]
Lord Eliwood... Thank you.[A][X]
