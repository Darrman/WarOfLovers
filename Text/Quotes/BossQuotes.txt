But... you've disappeared![A][Clear]

the Miracle Sword's might![A][X]

## MarthVsKrisCh1
[Left][LoadKris]
Emperor Marth?! Impossible![N]
You're in retirement with[AN]
Alear in Lythos! She said[N]
you were perfectly in love![AN]
Are you sick of your affair?[N]
Running back home to Sheeda?[A][Clear]
[Right][LoadMarth]
So, you're Kris? I think I[N]
remember who you are now.[AN]
[Clear][Left][LoadKris]
Ahem... I am your most loyal[N]
servant, Captain Kris of the[AN]
Royal Guard. Please forgive[N]
my prior statements. I am[AN]

## Ch10SubBossBattle
[Left][LoadExecutioner]
If you've any last words, you'd[N]
better say them now.[A][X]

## DiamantBattle
[Left][LoadDiamant]
I am Diamant, King of Brodia.[N]
You are a threat to Elyos's[AN]
overall peace and security.[N]
If Ostia stands, there is a[AN]
grave danger regarding the[N]
Physical Emblems. Nothing[AN]
short of victory will be[N]
sufficient for us![A][X]

## DiamantVsMarth
[Left][LoadDiamant]
Emblem Marth... When I first[N]
heard you lived, I was[AN]
deeply sceptical. But now[N]
I cannot deny the truth.[AN]
I know asking you to come[N]
back to Lythos politely[AN]
is futile. Therefore, I must[N]
force your hand.[A]
[Clear][Right][LoadMarth]
Diamant, have you considered[N]
for a second why you are[AN]
besieging Ostia? What reason[N]
does Alear have for this?[AN]
[Clear][Left][LoadDiamant]
She's learned lessons from[N]
your betrayal. Emblem Roy's[AN]
loved ones call Ostia home.[N]
They are a threat.[AN]
It is my duty to end such a[N]
threat to the Divine One![A][X]

## DiamantVsLilina
[Left][LoadDiamant]
Lilina of Ostia. You're the[N]
whole reason we're here.[AN]
[Right][Clear][LoadLilina]
You may look like Roy, but[N]
you are not him![AN]
Before you explain yourself,[N]
I'll be taking that ring![A]
[Clear][Left][LoadDiamant]
You can't remove the Emblem[N]
Ring off my finger so easily.[AN]
Even if you do kill me today,[N]
Emblem Roy himself is on[AN]
the Somniel. You'll never[N]
step foot there...[AN]
[Clear][Right][LoadLilina]
The damage the armies under[N]
your command have done to[AN]
Lycia... Alear's malign[N]
influence on all Elibe...[AN]
We will succeed. We will[N]
defend Ostia to the end.[A][X]

## DiamantVsEliwood
[Left][LoadDiamant]
So you're Emblem Roy's father.[N]
You're older than I thought...[AN]
But I shouldn't be surprised.[N]
Emblem Lyn fought long ago.[AN]
[Clear][Right][LoadEliwood]
You're imitating my son...[N]
You're overrunning my country...[AN]
And you're desecrating my[N]
friend's memory![AN]
[Clear][Left][LoadDiamant]
So you're implying Emblem Lyn[N]
is no longer with us?[AN]
This is... a complication.[N]
But not an insurmountable one.[AN][X]

## AlcrystBattle
[Left][LoadAlcryst]
If you escape, I will have[N]
failed the Divine One.[AN]
Brodia's future rests on[N]
my shoulders. I... I...[AN]
If I die, Brodia dies with[N]
me. My people... I must[AN]
stop you right here. You[N]
will not reach this ship![A][X]

## LapisBattle
[Left][LoadLapis]
I am Lapis, retainer of his[N]
highness. I must protect[AN]
him at all costs. Think you[N]
can beat me? I'm tough![A][X]

## VeyleBattleCh12
[Left][LoadVeyle]
None of you stand a chance[N]
against me. None of you[AN]
compare to me, let alone[N]
Alear. This is the end.[A][X]
