## MarthVsRyan
[Left][LoadRyan]

But... you've disappeared![A][Clear]

doing here? Impossible![A][Clear]

## LouisBattle

The Divine One is watching you.[N]
And I have kept a very close[AN]

## KrisCh1Battle

the Miracle Sword's might![A][X]

## MarthVsKrisCh1
[Left][LoadKris]
Emperor Marth?! Impossible![N]

Alear in Lythos! She said[N]
you were perfectly in love![AN]
Are you sick of your affair?[N]
Running back home to Sheeda?[A][Clear]
[Right][LoadMarth]
So, you're Kris? I think I[N]
remember who you are now.[AN]
[Clear][Left][LoadKris]
Ahem... I am your most loyal[N]
servant, Captain Kris of the[AN]
Royal Guard. Please forgive[N]
my prior statements. I am[AN]

## Ch10SubBossBattle
[Left][LoadExecutioner]
If you've any last words, you'd[N]
better say them now.[A][X]

## DiamantBattle
[Left][LoadDiamant]
I am Diamant, King of Brodia.[N]
You are a threat to Elyos's[AN]
overall peace and security.[N]
If Ostia stands, there is a[AN]
grave danger regarding the[N]
Physical Emblems. Nothing[AN]
short of victory will be[N]
sufficient for us![A][X]

## DiamantVsMarth
[Left][LoadDiamant]
Emblem Marth... When I first[N]
heard you lived, I was[AN]
deeply sceptical. But now[N]
I cannot deny the truth.[AN]
I know asking you to come[N]
back to Lythos politely[AN]
is futile. Therefore, I must[N]
force your hand.[A]
[Clear][Right][LoadMarth]
Diamant, have you considered[N]
for a second why you are[AN]
besieging Ostia? What reason[N]
does Alear have for this?[AN]
[Clear][Left][LoadDiamant]
She's learned lessons from[N]
your betrayal. Emblem Roy's[AN]
loved ones call Ostia home.[N]
They are a threat.[AN]
It is my duty to end such a[N]
threat to the Divine One![A][X]

## DiamantVsLilina
[Left][LoadDiamant]
Lilina of Ostia. You're the[N]
whole reason we're here.[AN]
[Clear][Right][LoadLilina]
You may look like Roy, but[N]
you are not him![AN]
Before you explain yourself,[N]
I'll be taking that ring![A]
[Clear][Left][LoadDiamant]
You can't remove the Emblem[N]
Ring off my finger so easily.[AN]
Even if you do kill me today,[N]
Emblem Roy himself is on[AN]
the Somniel. You'll never[N]
step foot there...[AN]
[Clear][Right][LoadLilina]
The damage the armies under[N]
your command have done to[AN]
Lycia... Alear's malign[N]
influence on all Elibe...[AN]
We will succeed. We will[N]
defend Ostia to the end.[A][X]

## DiamantVsEliwood
[Left][LoadDiamant]
So you're Emblem Roy's father.[N]
You're older than I thought...[AN]
But I shouldn't be surprised.[N]
Emblem Lyn fought long ago.[AN]
[Clear][Right][LoadEliwood]
You're imitating my son...[N]
You're overrunning my country...[AN]
And you're desecrating my[N]
friend's memory![AN]
[Clear][Left][LoadDiamant]
So you're implying Emblem Lyn[N]
is no longer with us?[AN]
This is... a complication.[N]
But not an insurmountable one.[AN][X]

## AlcrystBattle
[Left][LoadAlcryst]
If you escape, I will have[N]
failed the Divine One.[AN]
Brodia's future rests on[N]
my shoulders. I... I...[AN]

me. My people... I must[AN]
stop you right here. You[N]
will not reach this ship![A][X]

## LapisBattle
[Left][LoadLapis]

highness. I must protect[AN]
him at all costs. Think you[N]
can beat me? I'm tough![A][X]

## VeyleBattleCh12
[Left][LoadVeyle]
None of you stand a chance[N]
against me. None of you[AN]
compare to me, let alone[N]
Alear. This is the end.[A][X]

## ValboBattle

Just who are you people?[N]
Where did you come from?[AN]
Why are you attacking us?[N]
Well, you shall proceed[AN]
no further![A][X]

## EtieBattle
[Left][LoadEtie]
I've been waiting to give my[N]
muscles a workout! This[AN]
country has some interesting[N]
bows. Time to test one out![A][X]

## CleiveBattle
[Left][LoadCleive]
Akaneian scum! Your invasion[N]
ends here. You will never[AN]
darken the doors of Sofia[N]
Castle as long as I live![A][X]

## ClaireBattle
[Left][LoadClaire]
So, it has come to this?[N]
I see how it is.[AN]
When this day is done,[N]
you shall be but a memory.[A][X]

## GreyBattle
[Left][LoadGrey]
So, you've made it inside[N]
the castle, eh?[AN]
No magic can touch me, and[N]
I'm a fast one, too.[A][X]

## MycenBattle
[Left][LoadMycen]
Oh, we truly are doomed...[N]
Your majesty, why did you[AN]
declare this foolish war?[N]
Akaneia have taken it[AN]
very seriously. Now, I will[N]
fight for the last time.[A][X]

## DomaBossBattle
[Left][LoadDomaBoss]
We've been forced underground[N]
by that damnable United[AN]
Valencia! I care not for[N]
your cause, but as part[AN]
of a deal we must assist[N]
Celine and the Firenese.[AN]
I know better than to[N]
betray her for no reason.[AN]
So, quiver in fear with[N]
my terrible magic![A][X]

## CelineBattle
[Left][LoadRedCeline]
If I fall here, Firene is[N]
finished.[AN]
If I fall here, the Divine[N]
One will be distraught.[AN]
If I fall here, no miracle will[N]
save me from my mortality.[AN]
And that is why I must fight![N]
For the fate of Firene![A][X]

## CelineVsMarth
[Left][LoadRedCeline]
Emblem Marth. I believe we[N]
are both set in our ways.[AN]
[Clear][Right][LoadMarth]
Emblem... This whole war[N]
revolves around them.[AN]
As if the world is just[N]
Alear's play thing.[AN]
[Clear][Left][LoadRedCeline]
...You may have a point.[N]
But our paths are set.[AN]
Em-- no. Marth, show me[N]
your best. Let us see[AN]
whose virtue shines true[N]
today. For Firene![A]
[Clear][Right][LoadMarth]
For peace. For prosperity.[N]
And for the world.[A][X]

## AlmBattle
[Left][LoadAlm]
This is it. You worthless[N]
warmongers. You just appear[AN]
by the floodgate, tear your[N]
way through Sofia, and now[AN]
you are intent on destroying[N]
everything we hold dear![AN]
You may have kidnapped Celica[N]
before she made her escape.[AN]
You may have funded the Doma[N]
Faithful's resurgence.[AN]
But I'll be damned if I can't[N]
cut you down right now![A][X]

## AlmVsMarth
[Right][LoadMarth]
Alm, it's not too late. I[N]
do not want to fight.[AN]
[Clear][Left][LoadAlm]
What kind of shameless liar[N]
are you? Identify yourself.[AN]
[Clear][Right][LoadMarth]
I am Marth, the commander[N]
of the Akaneian forces.[AN]
[Clear][Left][LoadAlm]
I see. Two emperors facing[N]
each other down.[AN]
Let us see which is stronger:[N]
Akaneia, or Valencia?[A][X]

## AthenaBattle
[Left][LoadAthena]
Ve are interested in a fight.[N]
Come, ve shall duel![A][X]

Did you find him first?[A][X]

## ChloeBattle
[Left][LoadChloe]
I am Chloe, knight of Firene.[N]
I have to assist these people,[AN]
and so I am. The Divine One and[N]
her majesty need my help![A][X]

## DomaMinionBattle
[Left][LoadDomaMinion]
He he he... I've had enough of[N]
being pushed around by Alm[AN]
and his cronies. The Doma[N]
Faithful shall rise again![A][X]
